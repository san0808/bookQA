Ichir o Kishimi  was born in Kyoto, where he still lives, in
1956. He has aspired to become a philosopher since his days
in high school. Since 1989, while specialising in Classical
W estern philosophy with a focus on Platonic philosophy , he
has researched Adlerian psychology; he writes and lectures on
the subject and provides counselling for youths in psychiatric
clinics as a certified counsellor and consultant for the Japanese
Society of Adlerian Psychology . He is the translator , into
Japanese, of selected writings by Alfred Adler— Kojin
Shinrigaku Kogi  (The Science of Living) and Hito wa Naze
Shinkeisho ni Naru no ka  (Problems of Neurosis)—and he is
the author of Adora Shinrigaku Nyumon  (Introduction to
Adlerian Psychology), in addition to numerous other books.
Fumitake Koga , an award-winning professional writer and
author , was born in 1973. He has released numerous
bestselling works of business-related and general non-fiction.
He encountered Adlerian psychology in his late twenties and
was deeply af fected by its conventional wisdom defying ideas.
Thereafter , Koga made numerous visits to Ichiro Kishimi in
Kyoto, gleaned from him the essence of Adlerian psychology
and took down the notes for the classical ‘dialogue format’
method of Greek philosophy that is used in this book.First published in Japan as Kirawar eru Y uki  by Diamond Inc., T okyo, in 2013

AfterwordOn the outskirts of the thousand-year -old city lived a
philosopher who taught that the world was simple and that
happiness was within the r each of every man, instantly . A
young man who was dissatisfied with life went to visit this
philosopher to get to the heart of the matter . This youth
found the world a chaotic mass of contradictions and, in
his anxious eyes, any notion of happiness was completely
absurd.I N T R O D U C T I O N
YOUTH:  I want to ask you once again; you do believe that the
world is, in all ways, a simple place?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, this world is astonishingly simple and life
itself is, too.
YOUTH:  So, is this your idealistic ar gument or is it a workable
theory? What I mean is, are you saying that any issues you or I
face in life are simple too?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, of course.
YOUTH:  Alright then, but let me explain why I have come to
visit you today . Firstly , I want to debate this with you until I
am satisfied, and then, if possible, I want to get you to retract
this theory .
PHILOSOPHER:  Ha-ha.
YOUTH:  Because I have heard all about your reputation. The
word is that there is an eccentric philosopher living here
whose teachings and ar guments are hard to ignore, namely ,
that people can change, that the world is simple and that
everyone can be happy . That is the sort of thing I have heard,
but I find that view totally unacceptable, so I wanted to
confirm things for myself. If I find anything you say
completely of f, I will point it out and then correct you … But
will you find that annoying?
PHILOSOPHER:  No, I would welcome the opportunity . I have
been hoping to hear from a young person just like you and to
learn as much as possible from what you can tell me.
YOUTH:  Thanks. I do not intend to dismiss you out of hand. I
will take your views into consideration and then look at the
possibilities that present themselves. ‘The world is simple and
life is simple too’—if there is anything in this thesis that might
contain truth, it would be life from a child’ s point of view .
Children do not have any obvious duties, like paying taxes or
going to work. They are protected by their parents and society ,
and can spend days free from care. They can imagine a futurethat goes on forever and do whatever they want. They don’ t
have to see grim reality—they are blindfolded. So, to them the
world must have a simple form. However , as a child matures
to adulthood the world reveals its true nature. V ery shortly , the
child will know how things really are and what he is really
allowed to do. His opinion will alter and all he will see is
impossibility . His romantic view will end and be replaced by
cruel realism.
PHILOSOPHER:  I see. That is an interesting view .
YOUTH:  That’ s not all. Once grown up, the child will get
entangled in all kinds of complicated relationships with people
and have all kinds of responsibilities thrust upon him. That is
how life will be, both at work and at home, and in any role he
assumes in public life. It goes without saying that he will
become aware of the various issues in society that he couldn’ t
understand as a child, including discrimination, war and
inequality , and he will not be able to ignore them. Am I
wrong?
PHILOSOPHER:  It sounds fine to me. Please continue.
YOUTH:  W ell, if we were still living at a time when religion
held sway , salvation might be an option, because the teachings
of the divine were everything to us. All we had to do was obey
them and consequently have little to think about. But religion
has lost its power and now there is no real belief in God. W ith
nothing to rely on, everyone is filled with anxiety and doubt.
Everyone is living for themselves. That is how society is
today , so please tell me—given these realities and in the light
of what I have said—can you still say the world is simple?
PHILOSOPHER:  There is no change in what I say . The world is
simple and life is simple too.
YOUTH:  How? Anyone can see that it’ s a chaotic mass of
contradictions.
PHILOSOPHER:  That is not because the world is complicated. It’ s
because you are making the world complicated.
YOUTH:  I am?PHILOSOPHER:  None of us live in an objective world, but
instead in a subjective world that we ourselves have given
meaning to. The world you see is dif ferent from the one I see,
and it’ s impossible to share your world with anyone else.
YOUTH:  How can that be? Y ou and I are living in the same
country , in the same time, and we are seeing the same things—
aren’ t we?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y ou look rather young to me, but have you ever
drunk well water that has just been drawn?
YOUTH:  W ell water? Um, it was a long time ago, but there was
a well at my grandmother ’ s house in the countryside. I
remember enjoying the fresh, cold water drawn from that well
on a hot summer ’ s day .
PHILOSOPHER:  Y ou may know this, but well water stays at
pretty much the same temperature all year round, at about 18
degrees. That is an objective number—it stays the same to
everyone who measures it. But when you drink the water in
the summer it seems cool and when you drink the same water
in the winter it seems warm. Even though it’ s the same water ,
at the same 18 degrees according to the thermometer , the way
it seems depends on whether it’ s summer or winter .
YOUTH:  So, it’ s an illusion caused by the change in the
environment.
PHILOSOPHER:  No, it’ s not an illusion. Y ou see, to you, in that
moment, the coolness or warmth of the well water is an
undeniable fact. That’ s what it means to live in your subjective
world. There is no escape from your own subjectivity . At
present, the world seems complicated and mysterious to you,
but if you change, the world will appear more simple. The
issue is not about how the world is, but about how you are.
YOUTH:  How I am?
PHILOSOPHER:  Right … It’ s as if you see the world through dark
glasses, so naturally everything seems dark. But if that is the
case, instead of lamenting about the world’ s darkness, you
could just remove the glasses. Perhaps the world will appear
terribly bright to you then and you will involuntarily shut youreyes. Maybe you’ll want the glasses back on, but can you even
take them of f in the first place? Can you look directly at the
world? Do you have the courage?
YOUTH:  Courage?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, it’ s a matter of courage.
YOUTH:  W ell alright. There are tons of objections I would like
to raise, but I get the feeling it would be better to go into them
later . I would like to confirm that you are saying ‘people can
change’, right?
PHILOSOPHER:  Of course people can change. They can also find
happiness.
YOUTH:  Everyone, without exception?
PHILOSOPHER:  No exceptions whatsoever .
YOUTH:  Ha-ha! Now you’re talking big! This is getting
interesting. I’m going to start ar guing with you immediately .
PHILOSOPHER:  I am not going to run away or hide anything.
Let’ s take our time debating this. So, your position is ‘people
cannot change?’
YOUTH:  That’ s right, they can’ t change. Actually , I am
suf fering myself because of not being able to change.
PHILOSOPHER:  And at the same time, you wish you could.
YOUTH:  Of course. If I could change, if I could start life all
over again, I would gladly fall to my knees before you. But it
could turn out that you’ll be down on your knees before me.
PHILOSOPHER:  Y ou remind me of myself during my own
student days, when I was a hot-blooded young man searching
for the truth, traipsing about, calling on philosophers …
YOUTH:  Y es. I am searching for the truth. The truth about life.
PHILOSOPHER:  I have never felt the need to take in disciples and
have never done so. However , since becoming a student of
Greek philosophy and then coming into contact with another
philosophy , I have been waiting for a long time for a visit from
a young person like you.YOUTH:  Another philosophy? What would that be?
PHILOSOPHER:  My study is just over there. Go into it. It’ s going
to be a long night. I will go and make some hot cof fee.The young man enter ed the study and sat slouched in a
chair . Why was he so determined to r eject the
philosopher ’ s theories? His r easons wer e abundantly clear .
He lacked self-confidence and, ever since childhood, this
had been compounded by deep-seated feelings of
inferiority with r egard to his personal and academic
backgr ounds, as well as his physical appearance. Perhaps,
as a r esult, he tended to be excessively self-conscious when
people looked at him. Mostly , he seemed incapable of truly
appr eciating other people’ s happiness, and was constantly
pitying himself. T o him, the philosopher ’ s claims wer e
nothing mor e than the stuff of fantasy .T H E  U N K N O W N  ‘ T H I R D  G I A N T ’
YOUTH:  A moment ago, you used the words ‘another
philosophy’, but I’ve heard that your specialty is in Greek
philosophy .
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, Greek philosophy has been central to my
life ever since I was a teenager . The great intellectual figures:
Socrates, Plato, Aristotle. I am translating a work by Plato at
the moment, and I expect to spend the rest of my life studying
classical Greek thought.
YOUTH:  W ell, then what is this ‘other philosophy’?
PHILOSOPHER:  It is a completely new school of psychology that
was established by the Austrian psychiatrist, Alfred Adler , at
the beginning of the twentieth century . In this country , it is
generally referred to as Adlerian psychology .
YOUTH:  Huh. I never would have imagined that a specialist in
Greek philosophy would be interested in psychology .
PHILOSOPHER:  I’m not very familiar with paths taken by other
schools of psychology . However , I think it is fair to say that
Adlerian psychology is clearly in line with Greek philosophy ,
and that it is a proper field of study .
YOUTH:  I have a passing knowledge of the psychology of Freud
and Jung. A fascinating field.
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, Freud and Jung are both renowned. Even
here. Adler was one of the original core members of the
V ienna Psychoanalytic Society , which was led by Freud. His
ideas were counter to Freud’ s, and he split from the group and
proposed an ‘individual psychology’ based on his own original
theories.
YOUTH:  Individual psychology? Another odd term. So, Adler
was a disciple of Freud’ s?
PHILOSOPHER:  No, he was not. That misconception is common;
we must dispel it. For one thing, Adler and Freud were
relatively close in age, and the relationship they formed as
researchers was founded upon equal footing. In this respect,Adler was very dif ferent from Jung, who revered Freud as a
father figure. Though psychology primarily tends to be
associated with Freud and Jung, Adler is recognised
throughout the rest of the world, along with Freud and Jung, as
one of the three giants in this field.
YOUTH:  I see. I should have studied it more.
PHILOSOPHER:  I suppose it’ s only natural you haven’ t heard of
Adler . As he himself said, ‘There might come a time when one
will not remember my name; people might even have
for gotten that our school ever existed.’ Then he went on to say
that it didn’ t matter . The implication being that if his school
were for gotten, it would be because his ideas had outgrown the
bounds of a single area of scholarship, and become
commonplace, and a feeling shared by everyone. For example,
Dale Carnegie, who wrote the international bestsellers How to
W in Friends and Influence People  and How to Stop W orrying
and Start Living , referred to Adler as ‘a great psychologist
who devoted his life to researching humans and their latent
abilities’. The influence of Adler ’ s thinking is clearly present
throughout his writings. And in Stephen Covey’ s The 7 Habits
of Highly Effective People , much of the content closely
resembles Adler ’ s ideas. In other words, rather than being a
strict area of scholarship, Adlerian psychology is accepted as a
realisation; a culmination of truths and of human
understanding. Y et Adler ’ s ideas are said to have been a
hundred years ahead of their time, and even today we have not
managed to fully comprehend them. That is how truly ground
breaking they were.
YOUTH:  So, your theories are developed not from Greek
philosophy initially , but from the viewpoint of Adlerian
psychology?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, that’ s right.
YOUTH:  Okay . There’ s one more thing I’d like to ask about
your basic stance. Are you a philosopher? Or are you a
psychologist?
PHILOSOPHER:  I am a philosopher; a person who lives
philosophy . And, for me, Adlerian psychology is a form ofthought that is in line with Greek philosophy , and that is
philosophy .
YOUTH:  All right then. Let’ s get started.W H Y  P E O P L E  C A N  C H A N G E
YOUTH:  First, let’ s plan the points of discussion. Y ou say
people can change. Then you take it a step farther , saying that
everyone can find happiness.
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, everyone, without exception.
YOUTH:  Let’ s save the discussion about happiness for later and
address change first. Everyone wishes they could change. I
know I do, and I’m sure anyone you might stop and ask on the
street would agree. But why does everyone feel they want to
change? There’ s only one answer: because they cannot change.
If it were easy for people to change, they wouldn’ t spend so
much time wishing they could. No matter how much they wish
it, people cannot change. And that’ s why there are always so
many people getting taken in by new religions and dubious
self-help seminars, and any preaching on how everyone can
change. Am I wrong?
PHILOSOPHER:  W ell, in response, I’d ask why you are so
adamant that people can’ t change.
YOUTH:  Here’ s why . I have a friend, a guy , who has shut
himself in his room for several years. He wishes he could go
out, and even thinks he’d like to have a job, if possible. So, he
wants to change the way he is. I say this as his friend, but I
assure you he is a very serious person who could be of great
use to society . Except that he’ s afraid to leave his room. If he
takes even a single step outside, he suf fers palpitations and his
arms and legs shake. It’ s a kind of neurosis or panic, I suppose.
He wants to change, but he can’ t.
PHILOSOPHER:  What do you think the reason is that he can’ t go
out?
YOUTH:  I’m not really sure. It could be because of his
relationship with his parents, or because he was bullied at
school or work. He might have experienced a kind of trauma
from something like that. But then, it could be the opposite—
maybe he was too pampered as a child and can’ t face reality . Ijust don’ t know , and I can’ t pry into his past or his family
situation.
PHILOSOPHER:  So, you are saying there were incidents in your
friend’ s past that became the cause of trauma, or something
similar , and as a result he can’ t go out anymore?
YOUTH:  Of course. Before an ef fect, there’ s a cause. There is
nothing mysterious about that.
PHILOSOPHER:  Then perhaps the cause of his not being able to
go out anymore lies in the home environment during his
childhood. He was abused by his parents and reached
adulthood without ever feeling love. That’ s why he’ s afraid of
interacting with people and why he can’ t go out. It’ s feasible,
isn’ t it?
YOUTH:  Y es, it’ s entirely feasible. I’d imagine that would be
really challenging.
PHILOSOPHER:  And then you say , ‘Before an ef fect, there’ s a
cause.’ Or , in other words, who I am now (the ef fect) is
determined by occurrences in the past (the causes). Do I
understand correctly?
YOUTH:  Y ou do.
PHILOSOPHER:  So, if the here and now of everyone in the world
is due to their past incidents, according to you, wouldn’ t things
turn out very strangely? Don’ t you see? Everyone who has
grown up abused by his or her parents would have to suf fer the
same ef fects as your friend and become a recluse, or the whole
idea just doesn’ t hold water . That is, if the past actually
determines the present, and the causes control the ef fects.
YOUTH:  What, exactly , are you getting at?
PHILOSOPHER:  If we focus only on past causes and try to
explain things solely through cause and ef fect, we end up with
‘determinism’. Because what this says is that our present and
our future have already been decided by past occurrences, and
are unalterable. Am I wrong?
YOUTH:  So, you’re saying that the past doesn’ t matter?PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, that is the standpoint of Adlerian
psychology .
YOUTH:  I see. The points of conflict seem a bit clearer . But
look, if we go by your version, wouldn’ t that ultimately mean
that there’ s no reason my friend can’ t go out anymore?
Because you’re saying that past incidents don’ t matter . I’m
sorry , but that’ s completely out of the question. There has to be
some reason behind his seclusion. There has to be, or there’d
be no explanation!
PHILOSOPHER:  Indeed, there would be no explanation. So, in
Adlerian psychology , we do not think about past ‘causes’, but
rather about present ‘goals’.
YOUTH:  Present goals?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y our friend is insecure, so he can’ t go out. Think
about it the other way around. He doesn’ t want to go out, so
he’ s creating a state of anxiety .
YOUTH:  Huh?
PHILOSOPHER:  Think about it this way . Y our friend had the goal
of not going out beforehand, and he’ s been manufacturing a
state of anxiety and fear as a means to achieve that goal. In
Adlerian psychology , this is called ‘teleology’.
YOUTH:  Y ou’re joking! My friend has imagined his anxiety and
fear? So, would you go so far as saying that my friend is just
pretending to be sick?
PHILOSOPHER:  He is not pretending to be sick. The anxiety and
fear your friend is feeling are real. On occasion, he might also
suf fer from migraines and violent stomach cramps. However ,
these too are symptoms that he has created in order to achieve
the goal of not going out.
YOUTH:  That’ s not true! No way! That’ s too depressing!
PHILOSOPHER:  No. This is the dif ference between ‘aetiology’
(the study of causation) and teleology (the study of the
purpose of a given phenomenon, rather than its cause).
Everything you have been telling me is based in aetiology . As
long as we stay in aetiology , we will not take a single step
forward.T R A U M A  D O E S  N O T  E X I S T
YOUTH:  If you are going to state things so forcibly , I’d like a
thorough explanation. T o begin with, what is the dif ference
you refer to between aetiology and teleology?
PHILOSOPHER:  Supposing you’ve got a cold with a high fever ,
and you’ve gone to see the doctor . Then, suppose the doctor
says the reason for your sickness is that yesterday , when you
went out, you weren’ t dressed well enough, and that’ s why
you’ve caught a cold. Now , would you be satisfied with that?
YOUTH:  Of course I wouldn’ t. It wouldn’ t matter to me what
the reason was—the way I was dressed or because it was
raining, or whatever . It’ s the symptoms, the fact that I’m
suf fering with a high fever now that would matter to me. If
he’ s a doctor , I’d need him to treat me by prescribing
medicine, giving shots or taking whatever specialised
measures are necessary .
PHILOSOPHER:  Y et those who take an aetiological stance,
including most counsellors and psychiatrists, would ar gue that
what you were suf fering from stemmed from such-and-such
cause in the past, and would then end up just consoling you by
saying, ‘So you see, it’ s not your fault.’ The ar gument
concerning so-called traumas is typical of aetiology .
YOUTH:  W ait a minute! Are you denying the existence of
trauma altogether?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, I am. Adamantly .
YOUTH:  What! Aren’ t you, or I guess I should say Adler , an
authority on psychology?
PHILOSOPHER:  In Adlerian psychology , trauma is definitively
denied. This was a very new and revolutionary point.
Certainly , the Freudian view of trauma is fascinating. Freud’ s
idea is that a person’ s psychic wounds (traumas) cause his or
her present unhappiness. When you treat a person’ s life as a
vast narrative, there is an easily understandable causality and
sense of dramatic development that creates strong impressions
and is extremely attractive. But Adler , in denial of the traumaar gument, states the following: ‘No experience is in itself a
cause of our success or failure. W e do not suf fer from the
shock of our experiences—the so-called trauma—but instead
we make out of them whatever suits our purposes. W e are not
determined by our experiences, but the meaning we give them
is self-determining.’
YOUTH:  So, we make of them whatever suits our purposes?
PHILOSOPHER:  Exactly . Focus on the point Adler is making here
when he refers to the self being determined not by our
experiences themselves, but by the meaning we give them.  He
is not saying that the experience of a horrible calamity or
abuse during childhood or other such incidents have no
influence on forming a personality; their influences are strong.
But the important thing is that nothing is actually determined
by those influences. W e determine our own lives according to
the meaning we give to those past experiences. Y our life is not
something that someone gives you, but something you choose
yourself, and you are the one who decides how you live.
YOUTH:  Okay , so you’re saying that my friend has shut himself
in his room because he actually chooses to live this way? This
is serious. Believe me, it is not what he wants. If anything, it’ s
something he was forced to choose because of circumstances.
He had no choice other than to become who he is now .
PHILOSOPHER:  No. Even supposing that your friend actually
thinks I can’ t fit into society because I was abused by my
par ents , it’ s still because it is his goal  to think that way .
YOUTH:  What sort of goal is that?
PHILOSOPHER:  The immediate thing would probably be the goal
of ‘not going out’. He is creating anxiety and fear as his
reasons to stay inside.
YOUTH:  But why doesn’ t he want to go out? That’ s where the
problem resides.
PHILOSOPHER:  W ell, think of it from the parents’ view . How
would you feel if your child were shut up in a room?
YOUTH:  I’d be worried, of course. I’d want to help him return
to society; I’d want him to be well, and I’d wonder if I’draised him improperly . I’m sure I would be seriously
concerned, and try in every way imaginable to help him back
to a normal existence.
PHILOSOPHER:  That  is where the problem is.
YOUTH:  Where?
PHILOSOPHER:  If I stay in my room all the time, without ever
going out, my parents will worry . I can get all of my parents’
attention focused on me. They’ll be extremely careful around
me, and always handle me with kid gloves. On the other hand,
if I take even one step out of the house, I’ll just become part of
a faceless mass who no one pays attention to. I’ll be
surrounded by people I don’ t know , and just end up average,
or less than average. And no one will take special care of me
any longer … Such stories about reclusive people are not
uncommon.
YOUTH:  In that case, following your line of reasoning, my
friend has accomplished his goal, and is satisfied with his
current situation?
PHILOSOPHER:  I doubt he’ s satisfied, and I’m sure he’ s not
happy either . But there is no doubt that he is also taking action
in line with his goal. This is not something that is unique to
your friend. Every one of us is living in line with some goal.
That is what teleology tells us.
YOUTH:  No way . I reject that as completely unacceptable.
Look, my friend is—
PHILOSOPHER:  Listen, this discussion won’ t go anywhere if we
just keep talking about your friend. It will turn into a trial in
absentia, and that would be hopeless. Let’ s use another
example.
YOUTH:  W ell, how about this one? It’ s my own story about
something I experienced only yesterday .
PHILOSOPHER:  Oh? I’m all ears.P E O P L E  F A B R I C A T E  A N G E R
YOUTH:  Y esterday afternoon, I was reading a book in a cof fee
shop when a waiter passed by and spilled cof fee on my jacket.
I’d just bought it and it’ s my nicest piece of clothing. I
couldn’ t help it; I just blew my top. I yelled at him at the top
of my lungs. I’m not normally the type of person who speaks
loudly in public places. But yesterday , the shop was ringing
with the sound of my shouting because I flew into a rage and
for got what I was doing. So, how about that? Is there any
room for a goal to be involved here? No matter how you look
at it, isn’ t this behaviour that originates from a cause?
PHILOSOPHER:  So, you were stimulated by the emotion of anger ,
and ended up shouting. Though you are normally mild-
mannered, you couldn’ t resist being angry . It was an
unavoidable occurrence, and you couldn’ t do anything about
it. Is that what you are saying?
YOUTH:  Y es, because it happened so suddenly . The words just
came out of my mouth before I had time to think.
PHILOSOPHER:  Then just suppose you happened to have had a
knife on you yesterday , and when you blew up you just got
carried away and stabbed him. W ould you still be able to
justify that by saying, ‘It was an unavoidable occurrence, and I
couldn’ t do anything about it’?
YOUTH:  That … Come on, that’ s an extreme ar gument!
PHILOSOPHER:  It is not an extreme ar gument. If we proceed
with your reasoning, any of fence committed in anger can be
blamed on anger , and will no longer be the responsibility of
the person because, essentially , you are saying that people
cannot control their emotions.
YOUTH:  W ell, how do you explain my anger then?
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s easy . Y ou did not fly into a rage and then
start shouting. It is solely that you got angry so that you could
shout. In other words, in order to fulfil the goal of shouting,
you created the emotion of anger .YOUTH:  What do you mean?
PHILOSOPHER:  The goal of shouting came before anything else.
That is to say , by shouting, you wanted to make the waiter
submit to you and listen to what you had to say . As a means to
do that, you fabricated the emotion of anger .
YOUTH:  I fabricated it? Y ou’ve got to be joking!
PHILOSOPHER:  Then why did you raise your voice?
YOUTH:  As I said before, I blew my top. I was deeply
frustrated.
PHILOSOPHER:  No. Y ou could have explained matters without
raising your voice, and the waiter would most likely have
given you a sincere apology , wiped your jacket with a clean
cloth, and taken other appropriate measures. He might have
even arranged for it to be dry-cleaned. And somewhere in your
mind, you were anticipating that he might do these things but,
even so, you shouted. The procedure of explaining things in
normal words felt like too much trouble, and you tried to get
out of that and make this unresisting person submit to you.
The tool you used to do this was the emotion of anger .
YOUTH:  No way . Y ou can’ t fool me. I manufactured anger in
order to make him submit to me? I swear to you, there wasn’ t
even a second to think of such a thing. I didn’ t think it over
and then get angry . Anger is a more impulsive emotion.
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right, anger is an instantaneous emotion.
Now listen, I have a story . One day , a mother and daughter
were quarrelling loudly . Then, suddenly , the telephone rang.
‘Hello?’ The mother picked up the receiver hurriedly , her
voice still thick with anger . The caller was her daughter ’ s
homeroom teacher . As soon as the mother realised who was
phoning, the tone of her voice changed and she became very
polite. Then, for the next five minutes or so, she carried on a
conversation in her best telephone voice. Once she hung up, in
a moment, her expression changed again and she went straight
back to yelling at her daughter .
YOUTH:  W ell, that’ s not a particularly unusual story .PHILOSOPHER:  Don’ t you see? In a word, anger is a tool that can
be taken out as needed. It can be put away the moment the
phone rings, and pulled out again after one hangs up. The
mother isn’ t yelling in anger she cannot control. She is simply
using the anger to overpower her daughter with a loud voice,
and thereby assert her opinions.
YOUTH:  So, anger is a means to achieve a goal?
PHILOSOPHER:  That is what teleology says.
YOUTH:  Ah, I see now . Under that gentle-looking mask you
wear , you’re terribly nihilistic! Whether we’re talking about
anger or my reclusive friend, all your insights are stuf fed with
feelings of distrust for human beings!H O W  T O  L I V E  W I T H O U T  B E I N G
C O N T R O L L E D  B Y  T H E  P A S T
PHILOSOPHER:  How am I being nihilistic?
YOUTH:  Think about it. Simply put, you deny human emotion.
Y ou say that emotions are nothing more than tools; that they’re
just the means for achieving goals. But listen. If you deny
emotion, you’re upholding a view that tries to deny our
humanity , too. Because it’ s our emotions, and the fact that we
are swayed by all sorts of feelings that make us human. If
emotions are denied, humans will be nothing more than poor
excuses for machines. If that isn’ t nihilism, then what is?
PHILOSOPHER:  I am not denying that emotion exists. Everyone
has emotions. That goes without saying. But if you are going
to tell me that people are beings who can’ t resist emotion, I’d
ar gue against that. Adlerian psychology is a form of thought, a
philosophy that is diametrically opposed to nihilism. W e are
not controlled by emotion. In this sense, while it shows that
‘people are not controlled by emotion’, additionally it shows
that ‘we are not controlled by the past’.
YOUTH:  So, people are not controlled either by emotion or the
past?
PHILOSOPHER:  Okay , for example, suppose there is someone
whose parents had divorced in his past. Isn’ t this something
objective, the same as the well water that is always eighteen
degrees? But then, does that divorce feel cold or does it feel
warm? So, this is a ‘now’ thing, a subjective thing. Regardless
of what may have happened in the past, it is the meaning that
is attributed to it that determines the way someone’ s present
will be.
YOUTH:  The question isn’ t ‘what happened?’, but ‘how was it
resolved?’
PHILOSOPHER:  Exactly . W e can’ t go back to the past in a time
machine. W e can’ t turn back the hands of time. If you end upstaying in aetiology , you will be bound by the past and never
be able to find happiness.
YOUTH:  That’ s right! W e can’ t change the past, and that’ s
precisely why life is so hard.
PHILOSOPHER:  Life isn’ t just hard. If the past determined
everything and couldn’ t be changed, we who are living today
would no longer be able to take ef fective steps forward in our
lives. What would happen as a result? W e would end up with
the kind of nihilism and pessimism that loses hope in the
world and gives up on life. The Freudian aetiology that is
typified by the trauma ar gument is determinism in a dif ferent
form, and is the road to nihilism. Are you going to accept
values like that?
YOUTH:  I don’ t want to accept them, but the past is so
powerful.
PHILOSOPHER:  Think of the possibilities. If one assumes that
people are beings who can change, a set of values based on
aetiology becomes untenable, and one is compelled to take the
position of teleology as a matter of course.
YOUTH:  So, you are saying that one should always take the
‘people can change’ premise?
PHILOSOPHER:  Of course. And, please understand, it is Freudian
aetiology that denies our free will, and treats humans like
machines.
The young man paused and glanced ar ound the
philosopher ’ s study . Floor -to-ceiling bookshelves filled the
walls, and on a small wooden desk lay a fountain pen and
what appear ed to be a partially written manuscript.
‘People ar e not driven by past causes, but move toward
goals that they themselves set’—that was the philosopher ’ s
claim. The teleology he espoused was an idea that
overturned at the r oot the causality of r espectable
psychology , and the young man found that impossible to
accept. So, fr om which standpoint should he start to argue
it? The youth took a deep br eath.S O C R A T E S  A N D  A D L E R
YOUTH:  All right. Let me tell you about another friend of mine,
a man named Y . He’ s the kind of person who has always had a
bright personality and talks easily to anyone. He’ s like a
sunflower—everyone loves him, and people smile whenever
he’ s around. In contrast, I am someone who has never had an
easy time socially , and who’ s kind of warped in various ways.
Now , you are claiming that people can change through Adler ’ s
teleology?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. Y ou, I and everyone can change.
YOUTH:  Then, do you think I could become someone like Y?
From the bottom of my heart, I really wish I could be like him.
PHILOSOPHER:  At this point, I’d have to say that’ s totally out of
the question.
YOUTH:  Aha! Now you’re showing your true colours! So, are
you going to retract your theory?
PHILOSOPHER:  No, I am not. Unfortunately , you have almost no
understanding of Adlerian psychology yet. The first step to
change is knowing.
YOUTH:  So, if I can understand just something about Adlerian
psychology , can I become a person like Y?
PHILOSOPHER:  Why are you rushing for answers? Y ou should
arrive at answers on your own, and not rely upon what you get
from someone else. Answers from others are nothing more
than stopgap measures; they’re of no value. T ake Socrates,
who left not one book actually written by himself. He spent his
days having public debates with the citizens of Athens,
especially the young, and it was his disciple, Plato, who put
his philosophy into writing for future generations. Adler , too,
showed little interest in literary activities, preferring to engage
in personal dialogue at cafés in V ienna, and hold small
discussion groups. He was definitely not an armchair
intellectual.YOUTH:  So, Socrates and Adler both conveyed their ideas by
dialogue?
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right. All your doubts will be dispelled
through this dialogue. And you will begin to change. Not by
my words, but by your own doing. I do not want to take away
that valuable process of arriving at answers through dialogue.
YOUTH:  So, are we going to try and re-enact the kind of
dialogue that Socrates and Adler carried out? In this little
study?
PHILOSOPHER:  Isn’ t that good enough for you?
YOUTH:  That’ s what I’m hoping to find out! So, let’ s take it as
far as we can, until either you retract your theory or I bow
before you.A R E  Y O U  O K A Y  J U S T  A S  Y O U
A R E ?
PHILOSOPHER:  Okay , let’ s go back to your query . So, you’d like
to be a more upbeat person, like Y?
YOUTH:  But you just rejected that, and said it was out of the
question. W ell, I guess that’ s just how it is. I was just saying
that to give you a hard time—I know myself well enough. I
could never be someone like that.
PHILOSOPHER:  Why not?
YOUTH:  It’ s obvious. Because we have dif ferent personalities,
or I guess you could say dispositions.
PHILOSOPHER:  Hmm.
YOUTH:  Y ou, for instance, live surrounded by all these books.
Y ou read a new book and gain new knowledge. Basically , you
keep accumulating knowledge. The more you read, the more
your knowledge increases. Y ou find new concepts of value,
and it seems to you that they change you. Look, I hate to break
it to you, but no matter how much knowledge you gain, your
disposition or personality isn’ t going to basically change. If
your base gets skewed, all you’ve learned will be useless. Y es,
all the knowledge you’ve acquired will come crashing down
around you, and then the next thing you know , you’ll be back
to where you started! And the same goes for Adler ’ s ideas. No
matter how many facts I may try to accumulate about him,
they’re not going to have any ef fect on my personality .
Knowledge just gets piled up as knowledge, until sooner or
later it’ s discarded.
PHILOSOPHER:  Then let me ask you this. Why do you think you
want to be like Y? I guess you just want to be a dif ferent
person, whether it’ s Y or someone else. But what is the goal of
that?
YOUTH:  Y ou’re talking about goals again? As I said earlier , it’ s
just that I admire him and I think I’d be happier if I were like
him.PHILOSOPHER:  Y ou think you’d be happier if you were like him.
Which means that you are not happy now , right?
YOUTH:  What!
PHILOSOPHER:  Right now , you are unable to feel really happy .
This is because you have not learned to love yourself. And to
try to love yourself, you are wishing to be reborn as a dif ferent
person. Y ou’re hoping to become like Y , and throw away who
you are now . Correct?
YOUTH:  Y es, I guess that’ s right! Let’ s face it: I hate myself! I,
the one who’ s doing this playing around with old-fashioned
philosophical discourse, and who just can’ t help doing this sort
of thing—yes, I really hate myself.
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s all right. If you were to ask around for
people who say they like themselves, you’d be hard pressed to
find someone who’d puf f up their chest with pride and say ,
‘Y es, I like myself.’
YOUTH:  How about you? Do you like yourself?
PHILOSOPHER:  At the very least, I do not think I would like to
be a dif ferent person and I accept who I am.
YOUTH:  Y ou accept who you are?
PHILOSOPHER:  Look, no matter how much you want to be Y ,
you cannot be reborn as him. Y ou are not Y . It’ s okay for you
to be you. However , I am not saying it’ s fine to be ‘just as you
are’. If you are unable to really feel happy , then it’ s clear that
things aren’ t right just as they are. Y ou’ve got to put one foot
in front of the other , and not stop.
YOUTH:  That’ s a harsh way of putting it, but I get your point.
It’ s clear that I’m not right just the way I am. I’ve got to move
forward.
PHILOSOPHER:  T o quote Adler again: ‘The important thing is
not what one is born with, but what use one makes of that
equipment.’ Y ou want to be Y or someone else because you
are utterly focused on what you were born with. Instead,
you’ve got to focus on what you can make of your equipment.U N H A P P I N E S S  I S  S O M E T H I N G
Y O U  C H O O S E  F O R  Y O U R S E L F
YOUTH:  No way . That’ s unreasonable.
PHILOSOPHER:  Why is it unreasonable?
YOUTH:  Why? Some people are born into af fluent
circumstances with parents who are nice, and others are born
poor with bad parents. Because that’ s how the world is. And I
don’ t really want to get into this sort of subject, but things
aren’ t equal in the world and dif ferences between race,
nationality and ethnicity remain as deep as ever . It’ s only
natural to focus on what you were born with. All your talk is
just academic theory—you’re ignoring the real world!
PHILOSOPHER:  It is you who is ignoring reality . Does fixating
on what you are born with change the reality? W e are not
replaceable machines. It is not replacement we need, but
renewal.
YOUTH:  T o me, replacement and renewal are one and the same.
Y ou’re avoiding the main point. Look, there is such a thing as
unhappiness from birth. Please acknowledge that, first of all.
PHILOSOPHER:  I will not acknowledge that.
YOUTH:  Why?
PHILOSOPHER:  For one thing, right now you are unable to feel
real happiness. Y ou find living hard, and even wish you could
be reborn as a dif ferent person. But you are unhappy now
because you yourself chose ‘being unhappy’. Not because you
were born under an unlucky star .
YOUTH:  I chose to be unhappy? How can I possibly accept
that?
PHILOSOPHER:  There’ s nothing extraordinary about it. It’ s been
repeated ever since the classical Greek era. Have you heard the
saying ‘no one desires evil’? It’ s a proposition generally
known as a Socratic paradox.YOUTH:  There’ s no shortage of people who desire evil, is there?
Of course, there are plenty of thieves and murderers, and don’ t
for get all the politicians and of ficials with their shady deals.
It’ s probably harder to find a truly good, upright person who
does not desire evil.
PHILOSOPHER:  W ithout question, there is no shortage of
behaviour that is evil. But no one, not even the most hardened
criminal, becomes involved in crime purely out of a desire to
engage in evil acts. Every criminal has an internal justification
for getting involved in crime. A dispute over money leads
someone to engage in murder , for instance. T o the perpetrator ,
it is something for which there is a justification, and which can
be restated as an accomplishment of ‘good’. Of course, this is
not good in a moral sense, but good in the sense of being ‘of
benefit to oneself ’.
YOUTH:  Of benefit to oneself?
PHILOSOPHER:  The Greek word for ‘good’ ( agathon ) does not
have a moral meaning. It just means ‘beneficial’. Conversely ,
the word for ‘evil’ ( kakon ) means ‘not beneficial’. Our world
is rife with injustices and misdeeds of all kinds, yet there is not
one person who desires evil in the purest sense of the word;
that is to say something ‘not beneficial’.
YOUTH:  What does this have to do with me?
PHILOSOPHER:  At some stage in your life, you chose ‘being
unhappy’. It is not because you were born into unhappy
circumstances or ended up in an unhappy situation. It’ s that
you judged ‘being unhappy’ to be good for you.
YOUTH:  Why? What for?
PHILOSOPHER:  How do you justify this? Why did you choose to
be unhappy? I have no way of knowing the specific answer or
details. Perhaps it will become clearer as we debate this.
YOUTH:  Y ou are really trying to make a fool of me. Y ou think
this passes for philosophy? I do not accept this at all.
In spite of himself, the young man got up and glar ed at the
philosopher . I chose an unhappy life? Because it was good
for me? What an absurd argument! Why is he going to suchlengths to ridicule me? What did I do wrong? I’ll dismantle
his argument, no matter what it takes. I’ll make him kneel
before me.  The young man’ s face flushed with excitement.P E O P L E  A L W A Y S  C H O O S E  N O T
T O  C H A N G E
PHILOSOPHER:  Sit down. As things stand, it’ s only natural that
our views clash. I will now give a simple explanation as to the
manner in which humans are understood in Adlerian
psychology .
YOUTH:  Okay , but please be brief.
PHILOSOPHER:  Earlier you said that any person’ s disposition or
personality cannot be changed. In Adlerian psychology , we
describe personality and disposition with the word ‘lifestyle’.
YOUTH:  Lifestyle?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. Lifestyle is the tendencies of thought and
action in life.
YOUTH:  T endencies of thought and action?
PHILOSOPHER:  How one sees the world. And how one sees
oneself. Think of lifestyle as a concept bringing together these
ways of finding meaning. In a narrow sense, lifestyle could be
defined as someone’ s personality; taken more broadly , it is a
word that encompasses the worldview of that person and their
outlook on life.
YOUTH:  Their view of the world?
PHILOSOPHER:  Say there’ s someone who worries about himself
and says, ‘I am a pessimist.’ One could rephrase that to instead
say , ‘I have a pessimistic view of the world.’ Y ou could
consider that the issue is not personality , but rather the view of
the world. It seems that the word ‘personality’ is nuanced, and
suggests being unchangeable. But if we’re talking about a
view of the world, well then, that should be possible to alter .
YOUTH:  Hmm. This is kind of confusing. When you speak of a
lifestyle, do you mean a ‘way of living’?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, you could put it that way . T o be a little more
accurate, it is ‘the way one’ s life should be’. Y ou probably
think of disposition or personality as something with whichyou are endowed, without any connection to your will. In
Adlerian psychology , however , lifestyle is thought of as
something that you choose for yourself.
YOUTH:  That you choose for yourself?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, exactly . Y ou choose your lifestyle.
YOUTH:  So, not only did I choose to be unhappy , but I even
went so far as to choose this warped personality , too?
PHILOSOPHER:  Absolutely .
YOUTH:  Ha! Now you’re really pushing it. When I became
aware, I already had this personality . I certainly don’ t have any
recollection of having chosen it. But it’ s the same for you, isn’ t
it? Being able to choose one’ s own personality at will … Now
that sounds like you’re talking about robots, not people.
PHILOSOPHER:  Of course, you did not consciously choose ‘this
kind of self ’. Y our first choice was probably unconscious,
combined with external factors you have referred to; that is,
race, nationality , culture, and home environment. These
certainly had a significant influence on that choice.
Nevertheless, it is you who chose ‘this kind of self ’.
YOUTH:  I don’ t get what you’re saying. How on earth could I
have chosen it?
PHILOSOPHER:  Adlerian psychology’ s view is that it happens
around the age of ten.
YOUTH:  W ell, for ar gument’ s sake—and now I’m really going
out on a limb—say that when I was ten, I unconsciously made
this choice of lifestyle or whatever . W ould that even matter?
Y ou can call it personality or disposition or lifestyle, but,
regardless, I had already become ‘this kind of self ’. The state
of things doesn’ t change at all.
PHILOSOPHER:  That is not true. If your lifestyle is not something
that you were naturally born with, but something you chose
yourself, then it must be possible to choose it over again.
YOUTH:  Now you’re saying I can choose it all over?
PHILOSOPHER:  Maybe you haven’ t been aware of your lifestyle
until now , and maybe you haven’ t been aware of the conceptof lifestyle either . Of course, no one can choose his or her own
birth. Being born in this country , in this era, and with these
parents, are things you did not choose. And all these things
have a great deal of influence. Y ou’ll probably face
disappointment, and start looking at other people and feeling, I
wish I’d been born in their cir cumstances . But you can’ t let it
end there. The issue is not the past, but here, in the present.
And now you’ve learned about lifestyle. But what you do with
it from here on in is your responsibility . Whether you go on
choosing the lifestyle you’ve had up till now , or you choose a
new lifestyle altogether , it’ s entirely up to you.
YOUTH:  Then how do I choose again? Y ou’re telling me, ‘Y ou
chose that lifestyle yourself, so go ahead and select a new one
instantly ,’ but there’ s no way I can just change on the spot!
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, you can . People can change at any time,
regardless of the environments they are in. Y ou are only
unable to change because you are making the decision not to.
YOUTH:  What do you mean, exactly?
PHILOSOPHER:  People are constantly selecting their lifestyles.
Right now , while we are having this tête-a-tête, we are
selecting ours. Y ou describe yourself as an unhappy person.
Y ou say that you want to change right this minute. Y ou even
claim that you want to be reborn as a dif ferent person. After all
that then, why are you still unable to change? It is because you
are making the persistent decision not to change your lifestyle.
YOUTH:  No, don’ t you see that’ s completely illogical? I do
want to change; that is my sincere wish. So, how could I be
making the decision not to?
PHILOSOPHER:  Although there are some small inconveniences
and limitations, you probably think that the lifestyle you have
now is the most practical one, and that it’ s just easier to leave
things as they are. If you stay just like this, experience enables
you to respond properly to events as they occur , while
guessing the results of one’ s actions. Y ou could say it’ s like
driving your old, familiar car . It might rattle a bit, but one can
take that into account and manoeuvre easily . On the other
hand, if one chooses a new lifestyle, no one can predict whatmight happen to the new self, or have any idea how to deal
with events as they arise. It will be hard to see ahead to the
future, and life will be filled with anxiety . A more painful and
unhappy life might lie ahead. Simply put, people have various
complaints about things, but it’ s easier and more secure to be
just the way one is.
YOUTH:  One wants to change, but changing is scary?
PHILOSOPHER:  When we try to change our lifestyles, we put our
great courage to the test. There is the anxiety generated by
changing, and the disappointment attendant to not changing. I
am sure you have selected the latter .
YOUTH:  W ait … Just now , you used the word ‘courage’.
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. Adlerian psychology is a psychology of
courage. Y our unhappiness cannot be blamed on your past or
your environment. And it isn’ t that you lack competence. Y ou
just lack courage. One might say you are lacking in the
courage to be happy .Y O U R  L I F E  I S  D E C I D E D  H E R E
A N D  N O W
YOUTH:  The courage to be happy , huh?
PHILOSOPHER:  Do you need further explanation?
YOUTH:  No, hold on. This is getting confusing. First, you tell
me that the world is a simple place. That it only seems
complicated because of me, and that my subjective view is
making it that way . And also, that life just seems complicated
because I make it complicated, all of which is what makes it
dif ficult for me to live happily . Then, you say that one should
take the stance of teleology , as opposed to Freudian aetiology;
that one must not search for causes in one’ s past, and should
deny trauma. Y ou say that people act to achieve some goal or
other , instead of being creatures who are driven by causes in
their past. Right?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es.
YOUTH:  Furthermore, as the major premise of teleology , you
say that people can change. That people are always selecting
their own lifestyles.
PHILOSOPHER:  That is correct.
YOUTH:  So, I am unable to change because I myself keep
repeatedly making the decision not to change. I don’ t have
enough courage to choose a new lifestyle. In other words, I do
not have enough courage to be happy , and that’ s why I’m
unhappy . Have I got anything wrong?
PHILOSOPHER:  No, you haven’ t.
YOUTH:  Okay , in that case, my question is, what are the real
measures I should take? What do I need to do to change my
life? Y ou haven’ t explained all that yet.
PHILOSOPHER:  Y ou are right. What you should do now is make
a decision to stop your current lifestyle. For instance, earlier
you said, ‘If only I could be someone like Y , I’d be happy .’ As
long as you live that way , in the realm of the possibility of ‘ifonly such and such were the case’, you will never be able to
change. Because saying ‘if only I could be like Y’ is an excuse
to yourself for not changing.
YOUTH:  An excuse not to change?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. I have a young friend who dreams of
becoming a novelist, but who never seems to be able to
complete his work. According to him, his job keeps him too
busy , and he can never find enough time to write novels, and
that’ s why he can’ t complete work and enter it for writing
awards. But is that the real reason? No! It’ s actually that he
wants to leave the possibility of ‘I can do it if I try’ open, by
not committing to anything. He doesn’ t want to expose his
work to criticism, and he certainly doesn’ t want to face the
reality that he might produce an inferior piece of writing and
face rejection. He wants to live inside that realm of
possibilities, where he can say that he could do it if he only
had the time, or that he could write if he just had the proper
environment, and that he really does have the talent for it. In
another five or ten years, he will probably start using other
excuses like ‘I’m not young anymore’ or ‘I’ve got a family to
think about now .’
YOUTH:  I can relate all too well to how he must feel.
PHILOSOPHER:  He should just enter his writing for an award,
and if he gets rejected, so be it. If he did, he might grow , or
discover that he should pursue something dif ferent. Either
way , he would be able to move on. That is what changing your
current lifestyle is about. He won’ t get anywhere by not
submitting anything.
YOUTH:  But maybe his dreams will be shattered.
PHILOSOPHER:  W ell, I wonder . Having simple tasks—things that
should be done—while continually coming up with various
reasons why one can’ t do them sounds like a hard way to live,
doesn’ t it? So, in the case of my friend who dreams of
becoming a novelist, it is clearly the ‘I’, or the ‘self ’, that is
making life complicated and too dif ficult to live happily .
YOUTH:  But … That’ s harsh. Y our philosophy is too tough!PHILOSOPHER:  Indeed, it is strong medicine.
YOUTH:  Strong medicine! Y es, I agree.
PHILOSOPHER:  But, if you change your lifestyle—the way of
giving meaning to the world and yourself—then, both your
way of interacting with the world and your behaviour will
have to change as well. Do not for get this point: one will have
to change. Y ou, just as you are, have to choose your lifestyle.
It might seem hard, but it is really quite simple.
YOUTH:  According to you, there’ s no such thing as trauma, and
environment doesn’ t matter either . It’ s all just baggage, and
my unhappiness is my own fault, right? I’m starting to feel I’m
being criticised for everything I’ve ever been and done!
PHILOSOPHER:  No, you are not being criticised. Rather , as
Adler ’ s teleology tells us, ‘No matter what has occurred in
your life up to this point, it should have no bearing at all on
how you live from now on.’ That you, living in the here and
now , are the one who determines your own life.
YOUTH:  My life is determined at this exact point?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, because the past does not exist.
YOUTH:  All right. W ell, I don’ t agree with your theories one
hundred per cent. There are many points I’m not convinced
about, and that I would ar gue against. At the same time, your
theories are worth further consideration and I’m definitely
interested in learning more about Adlerian psychology . I think
I’ve had enough for tonight, but I hope you won’ t mind if I
come again next week. If I don’ t take a break, I think my head
might burst.
PHILOSOPHER:  I’m sure you need some time on your own to
think things over . I am always here, so you can visit whenever
you like. I enjoyed it. Thank you. Let’ s talk again.
YOUTH:  Great! One last thing, if I may . Our discussion today
was long and got pretty intense, and I guess I spoke rather
rudely . For that, I would like to apologise.
PHILOSOPHER:  Don’ t worry about it. Y ou should read Plato’ s
dialogues. The conduct and language of the disciples ofSocrates are surprisingly loose. That’ s the way a dialogue is
supposed to be.The young man was good to his word; exactly one week
later , he r eturned to the philosopher ’ s study . T ruth be told,
he’d felt the urge to rush back ther e only two or thr ee days
after his first visit. He had turned things over in his mind
very car efully , and his doubts had turned to certainty . In
short, teleology , the attributing of the purpose of a given
phenomenon, rather than its cause, was a sophistry , and
the existence of trauma was beyond question. People
cannot simply forget the past, and neither can they become
free from it.
T oday , the young man decided, he’d thor oughly
dismantle this eccentric philosopher ’ s theories and settle
matters once and for all.W H Y  Y O U  D I S L I K E  Y O U R S E L F
YOUTH:  So, after last time, I calmed myself down, focused, and
thought things over . And yet, I’ve got to say , I still can’ t agree
with your theories.
PHILOSOPHER:  Oh? What do you find questionable about them?
YOUTH:  W ell, for instance, the other day I admitted that I
dislike myself. No matter what I do, I can’ t find anything but
shortcomings, and I can see no reason why I’d start liking
myself. But, of course, I still want to. Y ou explain everything
as having to do with goals, but what kind of goal could I have
here? I mean, what kind of advantage could there be in my not
liking myself? I can’ t imagine there’d be a single thing to gain
from it.
PHILOSOPHER:  I see. Y ou feel that you don’ t have any strong
points; that you’ve got nothing but shortcomings. Whatever
the facts might be, that’ s how you feel. In other words, your
self-esteem is extremely low . So, the questions here, then, are
why do you feel so wretched? And, why do you view yourself
with such low esteem?
YOUTH:  Because that’ s a fact—I really don’ t have any strong
points.
PHILOSOPHER:  Y ou’re wrong. Y ou notice only your
shortcomings because you’ve resolved to not start liking
yourself. In order to not like yourself, you don’ t see your
strong points, and focus only on your shortcomings. First,
understand this point.
YOUTH:  I have resolved to not start liking myself?
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right. T o you, not liking yourself is a
virtue.
YOUTH:  Why? What for?
PHILOSOPHER:  Perhaps this is something you should think about
yourself. What sort of shortcomings do you think you have?YOUTH:  I’m sure you have already noticed. First of all, there’ s
my personality . I don’ t have any self-confidence, and I’m
always pessimistic about everything. And I guess I’m too self-
conscious, because I worry about what other people see, and,
then, I live with a constant distrust of other people. I can never
act naturally; there’ s always something theatrical about what I
say and do. And it’ s not just my personality—there’ s nothing
to like about my face or my body , either .
PHILOSOPHER:  When you go about listing your shortcomings
like that, what kind of mood does it put you in?
YOUTH:  W ow , that’ s nasty! An unpleasant mood, naturally . I’m
sure that no one would want to get involved with a guy as
warped as me. If there were anyone this wretched and
bothersome in my vicinity , I’d keep my distance, too.
PHILOSOPHER:  I see. W ell, that settles it then.
YOUTH:  What do you mean?
PHILOSOPHER:  It might be hard to understand from your own
example, so I’ll use another . I use this study for simple
counselling sessions. It must have been quite a few years ago,
but there was a female student who came by . She sat right
where you are sitting now , in the same chair . W ell, her concern
was her fear of blushing. She told me that she was always
turning red whenever she was out in public, and that she
would do anything to rid herself of this. So I asked her , ‘W ell,
if you can  cure it, what will you want to do then?’ And she
said that there was a man she wanted. She secretly had
feelings for him but wasn’ t ready to divulge them. Once her
fear of blushing was cured, she’d confess her desire to be with
him.
YOUTH:  Huh! All right, it sounds like the typical thing a female
student would seek counselling for . In order for her to confess
her feelings for him, first she had to cure her blushing
problem.
PHILOSOPHER:  But is that really the whole case? I have a
dif ferent opinion. Why did she get this fear of blushing? And
why hadn’ t it gotten better? Because she needed that symptom
of blushing.YOUTH:  What are you saying exactly? She was asking you to
cure it, wasn’ t she?
PHILOSOPHER:  What do you think was the scariest thing to her ,
the thing she wanted to avoid most of all? It was that the man
would reject her , of course. The fact that her unrequited love
would negate everything for her; the very existence and
possibility of ‘I’. This aspect is deeply present in adolescent
unrequited love. But as long as she has a fear of blushing, she
can go on thinking, I can’ t be with him because I have this fear
of blushing . It could end without her ever working up the
courage to confess her feelings to him, and she could convince
herself that he would reject her anyway . And finally , she can
live in the possibility that If only my fear of blushing had
gotten better , I could have  …
YOUTH:  Okay , so she fabricated that fear of blushing as an
excuse for her own inability to confess her feelings. Or maybe
as a kind of insurance for when he rejected her .
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, you could put it that way .
YOUTH:  Okay , that is  an interesting interpretation. But if that
were really the case, wouldn’ t it be impossible to do anything
to help her? Since she simultaneously needs that fear of
blushing, and is suf fering because of it, there’d be no end to
her troubles.
PHILOSOPHER:  W ell, this is what I told her: ‘Fear of blushing is
easy to cure.’ She asked, ‘Really?’ I went on: ‘But I will not
cure it.’ She pressed me, ‘Why?’ I explained, ‘Look, it’ s
thanks to your fear of blushing that you can accept your
dissatisfaction with yourself and the world around you, and
with a life that isn’ t going well. It’ s thanks to your fear of
blushing, and it’ s caused by it.’ She asked, ‘How could it be …
?’ I went on: ‘If I did cure it, and nothing in your situation
changed at all, what would you do? Y ou’d probably come here
again and say , “Give me back my fear of blushing.” And that
would be beyond my abilities.’
YOUTH:  Hmm.
PHILOSOPHER:  Her story certainly isn’ t unusual. Students
preparing for their exams think, If I pass, life will be r osy .Company workers think, If I get transferr ed, everything will
go well.  But even when those wishes are fulfilled, in many
cases nothing about their situations changes at all.
YOUTH:  Indeed.
PHILOSOPHER:  When a client shows up requesting a cure from
fear of blushing, the counsellor must not cure the symptoms. If
they do, recovery is likely to be even more dif ficult. That is
the Adlerian psychology way of thinking about this kind of
thing.
YOUTH:  So, what specifically do you do, then? Do you ask
what they’re worried about and then just leave it be?
PHILOSOPHER:  She didn’ t have confidence in herself. She was
very afraid that things being what they were, he’d reject her
even if she did confess to him. And, if that happened, she’d
lose even more confidence and get hurt. That’ s why she
created the symptom of the fear of blushing. What I can do is
to get the person first to accept ‘myself now’, and then
regardless of the outcome, have the courage to step forward. In
Adlerian psychology , this kind of approach is called
‘encouragement’.
YOUTH:  Encouragement?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. I’ll explain systematically what it consists
of once our discussion has progressed a little farther . W e’re not
at that stage yet.
YOUTH:  That works for me. In the meantime, I’ll keep the word
‘encouragement’ in mind. So, whatever happened to her?
PHILOSOPHER:  Apparently , she had the chance to join a group of
friends and spend time with the man, and in the end it was he
who confessed his desire to be with her . Of course, she never
dropped by this study again after that. I don’ t know what
became of her fear of blushing. But she probably didn’ t need it
any longer .
YOUTH:  Y es, she clearly didn’ t have any use for it anymore.
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right. Now , keeping this student’ s story in
mind, let’ s think about your problems. Y ou say that, at present,
you notice only your shortcomings, and it’ s unlikely thatyou’ll ever come to like yourself. And then, you said, ‘I’m
sure that no one would want to get involved with a guy as
warped as me,’ didn’ t you? I’m sure you understand this
already . Why do you dislike yourself? Why do you focus only
on your shortcomings, and why have you decided to not start
liking yourself? It’ s because you are overly afraid of being
disliked by other people and getting hurt in your interpersonal
relationships.
YOUTH:  What do you mean by that?
PHILOSOPHER:  Just like the young woman with the fear of
blushing, who was afraid of being rejected by the man, you are
afraid of being negated by other people. Y ou’re afraid of being
treated disparagingly; being refused, and sustaining deep
mental wounds. Y ou think that instead of getting entangled in
such situations, it would be better if you just didn’ t have
relations with anyone in the first place. In other words, your
goal is to not get hurt in your relationships with other people.
YOUTH:  Huh …
PHILOSOPHER:  Now , how can that goal be realised? The answer
is easy . Just find your shortcomings, start disliking yourself,
and become someone who doesn’ t enter into interpersonal
relationships. That way , if you can shut yourself into your own
shell, you won’ t have to interact with anyone, and you’ll even
have a justification ready whenever other people snub you.
That it’ s because of your shortcomings that you get snubbed,
and if things weren’ t this way , you too could be loved.
YOUTH:  Ha-ha! W ell, you’ve really put me in my place now .
PHILOSOPHER:  Don’ t be evasive. Being ‘the way I am’ with all
these shortcomings is, for you, a precious virtue. In other
words, something that’ s to your benefit.
YOUTH:  Ouch, that hurts. What a sadist; you’re diabolical!
Okay , yes, it’ s true: I am  afraid. I don’ t want to get hurt in
interpersonal relationships. I’m terrified of being snubbed for
who I am. It’ s hard to admit it, but you are right.
PHILOSOPHER:  Admitting is a good attitude. But don’ t for get,
it’ s basically impossible to not get hurt in your relations withother people. When you enter into interpersonal relationships,
it is inevitable that to a greater or lesser extent you will get
hurt, and you will hurt someone, too. Adler says, ‘T o get rid of
one’ s problems, all one can do is live in the universe all alone.’
But one can’ t do such a thing.A L L  P R O B L E M S  A R E
I N T E R P E R S O N A L
R E L A T I O N S H I P  P R O B L E M S
YOUTH:  W ait a minute! I’m supposed to just let that one slip
by? ‘T o get rid of one’ s problems, all one can do is live in the
universe all alone?’ What do you mean by that? If you lived
all alone, wouldn’ t you be horribly lonely?
PHILOSOPHER:  Oh, but being alone isn’ t what makes you feel
lonely . Loneliness is having other people and society and
community around you, and having a deep sense of being
excluded from them. T o feel lonely , we need other people.
That is to say , it is only in social contexts that a person
becomes an ‘individual’.
YOUTH:  If you were really alone, that is, if you existed
completely alone in the universe, you wouldn’ t be an
individual and you wouldn’ t feel lonely , either?
PHILOSOPHER:  I suppose the very concept of loneliness
wouldn’ t even come up. Y ou wouldn’ t need language, and
there’d be no use for logic or commonsense, either . But such a
thing is impossible. Even if you lived on an uninhabited
island, you would think about someone far across the ocean.
Even if you spend your nights alone, you strain your ears to
hear the sound of someone’ s breath. As long as there is
someone out there somewhere, you will be haunted by
loneliness.
YOUTH:  But then, you could just rephrase that as ‘if one could
live in the universe all alone, one’ s problems would go away’,
couldn’ t you?
PHILOSOPHER:  In theory , yes. As Adler goes so far as to assert,
‘All problems are interpersonal relationship problems.’
YOUTH:  Can you say that again?
PHILOSOPHER:  W e can repeat it as many times as you like: all
problems are interpersonal relationship problems. This is aconcept that runs to the very root of Adlerian psychology . If
all interpersonal relationships were gone from this world,
which is to say if one were alone in the universe and all other
people were gone, all manner of problems would disappear .
YOUTH:  That’ s a lie! It’ s nothing more than academic sophistry .
PHILOSOPHER:  Of course, we cannot do without interpersonal
relationships. A human being’ s existence, in its very essence,
assumes the existence of other human beings. Living
completely separate from others is, in principle, impossible.
As you are indicating, the premise ‘if one could live all alone
in the universe’ is unsound.
YOUTH:  That’ s not the issue I am talking about. Sure,
interpersonal relationships are probably a big problem. That
much I acknowledge. But to say that everything comes down
to interpersonal relationship problems, now that’ s really an
extreme position. What about the worry of being cut of f from
interpersonal relationships, the kind of problems that an
individual agonises over as an individual; problems directed to
oneself. Do you deny all that?
PHILOSOPHER:  There is no such thing as worry that is
completely defined by the individual; so-called internal worry
does not exist. Whatever the worry that may arise, the
shadows of other people are always present.
YOUTH:  But still, you’re a philosopher . Human beings have
loftier , greater problems than things like interpersonal
relationships. What is happiness, what is freedom? And what
is the meaning of life? Aren’ t these the themes that
philosophers have been investigating ever since the ancient
Greeks? And you’re saying, so what? Interpersonal
relationships are everything? It seems kind of pedestrian to
me. It’ s hard to believe that a philosopher would say such
things.
PHILOSOPHER:  W ell, then, it seems there’ s a need to explain
things a bit more concretely .
YOUTH:  Y es, please do! If you’re going to tell me that you’re a
philosopher , then you’ve got to really explain things, or else
this makes no sense.PHILOSOPHER:  Y ou were so afraid of interpersonal relationships
that you came to dislike yourself. Y ou’ve avoided
interpersonal relationships by disliking yourself.
These assertions shook the youth to his very cor e. The
words had an undeniable truth that seemed to pier ce his
heart. Even so, he had to find a clear r ebuttal to the
statement that all the pr oblems that people experience ar e
interpersonal r elationship pr oblems. Adler was trivialising
people’ s issues. The problems I’m suf fering from aren’ t so
mundane!F E E L I N G S  O F  I N F E R I O R I T Y  A R E
S U B J E C T I V E  A S S U M P T I O N S
PHILOSOPHER:  W ell, let’ s look at interpersonal relationships
from a slightly dif ferent perspective. Are you familiar with the
term ‘feeling of inferiority’?
YOUTH:  What a silly question. As you can surely tell from our
discussion up to now , I’m just a huge blob of feelings of
inferiority .
PHILOSOPHER:  What are those feelings, specifically?
YOUTH:  W ell, for instance, if I see something in a newspaper
about a person around my age, someone who’ s really
successful, I’m always overcome with these feelings of
inferiority . If someone else who’ s lived the same amount of
time I have is so successful, then what on earth am I doing
with myself? Or , when I see a friend who seems happy , before
I even feel like celebrating with them, I’m filled with envy and
frustration. Of course, this pimple-covered face doesn’ t help
matters, and I’ve got strong feelings of inferiority when it
comes to my education and occupation. And then there’ s my
income and social standing. I guess I’m just completely
riddled with feelings of inferiority .
PHILOSOPHER:  I see. Incidentally , Adler is thought to be the first
to use the term ‘feeling of inferiority’ in the kind of context in
which it is spoken of today .
YOUTH:  Huh, I didn’ t know that.
PHILOSOPHER:  In Adler ’ s native German, the word is
Minderwertigkeitsgefühl , which means a feeling ( Gefühl ) of
having less ( minder ) worth ( W ert ). So, ‘feeling of inferiority’
is a term that has to do with one’ s value judgement of oneself.
YOUTH:  V alue judgement?
PHILOSOPHER:  It’ s the feeling that one has no worth, or that one
is only worth so much.YOUTH:  Ah, that’ s a feeling I know well. That’ s me in a
nutshell. Not a day goes by without me tormenting myself that
there’ s no point in being alive.
PHILOSOPHER:  W ell, then, let’ s have a look at my own feelings
of inferiority . When you first met me, what was your
impression? In terms of physical characteristics.
YOUTH:  Um, well …
PHILOSOPHER:  There’ s no need to hold back. Be direct.
YOUTH:  All right, I guess you were smaller than I’d imagined.
PHILOSOPHER:  Thank you. I am 155 centimetres tall. Adler was
apparently around the same height. There was a time—until I
was right around your age, actually—when I was concerned
about my height. I was sure that things would be dif ferent if I
were of average height, twenty or even just ten centimetres
taller . As if a more enjoyable life were waiting for me. I talked
to a friend about it when I was having these feelings, and he
said it was ‘a bunch of nonsense’, and simply dismissed it.
YOUTH:  That’ s horrible! Some friend.
PHILOSOPHER:  And then he said, ‘What would you do if you got
taller? Y ou know , you’ve got a gift for getting people to relax.’
W ith a man who’ s big and strong, it’ s true, it does seem he can
end up intimidating people just because of his size. W ith
someone small like me, on the other hand, people let go of
their wariness. So, it made me realise that having a small build
was a desirable thing both to me and to those around me. In
other words, there was a transformation of values. I’m not
worried about my height anymore.
YOUTH:  Okay , but that’ s—
PHILOSOPHER:  W ait until I am finished. The important thing
here is that my height of 155 centimetres wasn’ t inferior .
YOUTH:  It wasn’ t inferior?
PHILOSOPHER:  It was not, in fact, lacking in or lesser than
something. Sure, my 155 centimetres is less than the average
height, and an objectively measured number . At first glance,one might think it inferior . But the issue is really what sort of
meaning I attribute to that height; what sort of value I give it.
YOUTH:  What does that mean?
PHILOSOPHER:  My feelings about my height were all subjective
feelings of inferiority , which arose entirely through my
comparing myself to others. That is to say , in my interpersonal
relationships. Because if there hadn’ t been anyone with whom
to compare myself, I wouldn’ t have had any occasion to think
I was short. Right now , you too are suf fering from various
feelings of inferiority . But please understand that what you are
feeling is not an objective inferiority , but a subjective feeling
of inferiority . Even with an issue like height, it’ s all reduced to
its subjectivity .
YOUTH:  In other words, the feelings of inferiority we’re
suf fering from are subjective interpretations rather than
objective facts?
PHILOSOPHER:  Exactly . Seeing it from my friend’ s point of view
that I get people to relax or that I don’ t intimidate them—such
aspects can become strong points. Of course, this is a
subjective interpretation. Y ou could even say it’ s an arbitrary
assumption. However , there is one good thing about
subjectivity: it allows you to make your own choice. Precisely
because I am leaving it to subjectivity , the choice to view my
height as either an advantage or disadvantage is left open to
me.
YOUTH:  The ar gument that you can choose a new lifestyle?
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right. W e cannot alter objective facts. But
subjective interpretations can be altered as much as one likes.
And we are inhabitants of a subjective world. W e talked about
this at the very beginning, right?
YOUTH:  Y es; the well water that’ s eighteen degrees.
PHILOSOPHER:  Now , remember the German word for a feeling
of inferiority , Minderwertigkeitsgefühl . As I mentioned a
moment ago, ‘feeling of inferiority’ is a term that has to do
with one’ s value judgement of oneself. Then, what on earth
could this value be? Okay , take diamonds, for instance, whichare traded at a high value. Or currency . W e find particular
values for these things, and say that one carat is this much, that
prices are such and such. But if you change your point of view ,
a diamond is nothing but a little stone.
YOUTH:  W ell, intellectually , it is.
PHILOSOPHER:  In other words, value is something that’ s based
on a social context. The value given to a one-dollar bill is not
an objectively attributed value, though that might be a
commonsense approach. If one considers its actual cost as
printed material, the value is nowhere near a dollar . If I were
the only person in this world and no one else existed, I’d
probably be putting those one-dollar bills in my fireplace in
wintertime. Maybe I’d be using them to blow my nose.
Following exactly the same logic, there should have been no
reason at all for me to worry about my height.
YOUTH:  If you were the only person in this world and no one
else existed?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. The problem of value in the end brings us
back to interpersonal relationships again.
YOUTH:  So, this connects to what you were saying about all
problems being interpersonal relationship problems?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, that’ s correct.A N  I N F E R I O R I T Y  C O M P L E X  I S
A N  E X C U S E
YOUTH:  But can you say for sure that feelings of inferiority are
really a problem of interpersonal relationships? Even the kind
of person who is regarded socially as a success, who doesn’ t
need to debase himself in relationships with other people, still
has some feelings of inferiority? Even the businessman who
amasses enormous wealth, the peerless beauty who is the envy
of all, and the Olympic gold medallist—every one of them
would be plagued by feelings of inferiority . W ell, that’ s how it
seems to me. How should  I think about this?
PHILOSOPHER:  Adler recognises that feelings of inferiority are
something everyone has. There’ s nothing bad about feelings of
inferiority themselves.
YOUTH:  So, why do people have them in the first place?
PHILOSOPHER:  It’ s probably necessary to understand this in a
certain order . First of all, people enter this world as helpless
beings. And people have the universal desire to escape from
that helpless state. Adler called this the ‘pursuit of superiority’.
YOUTH:  Pursuit of superiority?
PHILOSOPHER:  This is something you could think of as simply
‘hoping to improve’ or ‘pursuing an ideal state’. For instance,
a toddler learns to steady himself on both legs. He has the
universal desire to learn language and to improve. And all the
advancements of science throughout human history are due to
this ‘pursuit of superiority’, too.
YOUTH:  Okay . And then?
PHILOSOPHER:  The counterpart of this is the feeling of
inferiority . Everyone is in this ‘condition of wanting to
improve’ that is the pursuit of superiority . One holds up
various ideals or goals, and heads toward them. However , on
not being able to reach one’ s ideals, one harbours a sense of
being lesser . For instance, there are chefs who, the more
inspired and accomplished they become, are forever beset withthe sort of feeling of inferiority that makes them say to
themselves, I’m still not good enough , or I’ve got to bring my
cooking to the next level , and that sort of thing.
YOUTH:  That’ s true.
PHILOSOPHER:  Adler is saying that the pursuit of superiority and
the feeling of inferiority are not diseases, but stimulants to
normal, healthy striving and growth. If it is not used in the
wrong way , the feeling of inferiority , too, can promote striving
and growth.
YOUTH:  The feeling of inferiority is a kind of launch pad?
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right. One tries to get rid of one’ s feeling
of inferiority , and keep moving forward. One’ s never satisfied
with one’ s present situation—even if it’ s just a single step, one
wants to make progress. One wants to be happier . There is
absolutely nothing wrong with the state of this kind of feeling
of inferiority . There are, however , people who lose the courage
to take a single step forward, and who cannot accept the fact
that the situation can be changed by making realistic ef forts.
People who, before even doing anything, simply give up and
say things like, ‘I’m not good enough anyway ,’ or ‘Even if I
tried, I wouldn’ t stand a chance.’
YOUTH:  W ell, that’ s true. There’ s no doubt about it—if the
feeling of inferiority is strong, most people will become
negative and say , ‘I’m not good enough anyway .’ Because
that’ s what a feeling of inferiority is.
PHILOSOPHER:  No, that’ s not a feeling of inferiority—that’ s an
inferiority complex.
YOUTH:  A complex? That’ s what the feeling of inferiority is,
isn’ t it?
PHILOSOPHER:  Be careful. The way the word ‘complex’ is used
today in our country , it seems to have the same meaning as
‘feeling of inferiority’. Y ou hear people saying, ‘I’ve got a
complex about my eyelids’, or ‘He’ s got a complex about his
education’; that sort of thing. This is an utter misuse of the
term. At base, ‘complex’ refers to an abnormal mental state
made up of a complicated group of emotions and ideas, andhas nothing to do with the feeling of inferiority . For instance,
there’ s Freud’ s Oedipus complex, which is used in the context
of discussing the abnormal attraction of the child to the
opposite-sex parent.
YOUTH:  Y es. The nuances of abnormality are especially strong
when it comes to the mother complex and the father complex.
PHILOSOPHER:  For the same reason, then, it’ s crucial to not mix
up ‘feeling of inferiority’ and ‘inferiority complex’, and to
think about them as clearly separate.
YOUTH:  Concretely , how are they dif ferent?
PHILOSOPHER:  There is nothing particularly wrong with the
feeling of inferiority itself. Y ou understand this point now ,
right? As Adler says, the feeling of inferiority can be a trigger
for striving and growth. For instance, if one had a feeling of
inferiority with regard to one’ s education, and resolved to
oneself, I’m not well educated, so I’ll just have to try har der
than anyone else , that would be a desirable direction. The
inferiority complex, on the other hand, refers to a condition of
having begun to use one’ s feeling of inferiority as a kind of
excuse. So, one thinks to oneself, I’m not well educated, so I
can’ t succeed , or I’m not good-looking, so I can’ t get married .
When someone is insisting on the logic of ‘A is the situation,
so B cannot be done’ in such a way in everyday life, that is not
something that fits in the feeling of inferiority category . It is an
inferiority complex.
YOUTH:  No, it’ s a legitimate causal relationship. If you’re not
well educated, it takes away your chances of getting work or
making it in the world. Y ou’re regarded as low on the social
scale, and you can’ t succeed. That’ s not an excuse at all. It’ s
just a cold hard fact, isn’ t it?
PHILOSOPHER:  No, you are wrong.
YOUTH:  How? Where am I wrong?
PHILOSOPHER:  What you are calling a causal relationship is
something that Adler explains as ‘apparent cause and ef fect’.
That is to say , you convince yourself that there is some serious
causal relationship where there is none whatsoever . The otherday , someone told me, ‘The reason I can’ t get married easily is
that my parents got divorced when I was a child.’ From the
viewpoint of Freudian aetiology (the attributing of causes), the
parents’ divorce was a great trauma, which connects in a clear
causal relationship with one’ s views on marriage. Adler ,
however , with his stance of teleology (the attributing of
purpose), rejects such ar guments as ‘apparent cause and
ef fect’.
YOUTH:  But even so, the reality is that having a good education
makes it easier to be successful in society . I had thought you
were wise to the ways of the world.
PHILOSOPHER:  The real issue is how one confronts that reality .
If what you are thinking is, I’m not well educated, so I can’ t
succeed , then instead of I can’ t succeed , you should think, I
don’ t want to succeed .
YOUTH:  I don’ t want to succeed? What kind of reasoning is
that?
PHILOSOPHER:  It’ s simply that it’ s scary to take even one step
forward; also, that you don’ t want to make realistic ef forts.
Y ou don’ t want to change so much that you’d be willing to
sacrifice the pleasures you enjoy now—for instance, the time
you spend playing and engaged in hobbies. In other words,
you’re not equipped with the courage  to change your lifestyle.
It’ s easier with things just as they are now , even if you have
some complaints or limitations.B R A G G A R T S  H A V E  F E E L I N G S
O F  I N F E R I O R I T Y
YOUTH:  Maybe so, but …
PHILOSOPHER:  Further , you harbour an inferiority complex
about education and think, I’m not well educated, so I can’ t
succeed . Put the other way around, the reasoning can be, If
only I wer e well educated, I could be r eally successful .
YOUTH:  Hmm, true.
PHILOSOPHER:  This is the other aspect of the inferiority
complex. Those who manifest their inferiority complexes in
words or attitudes, who say that ‘A is the situation, so B
cannot be done’, are implying that if only it were not for A, I’d
be capable and have value.
YOUTH:  If only it weren’ t for this, I could do it, too.
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. As Adler points out, no one is capable of
putting up with having feelings of inferiority for a long period
of time. Feelings of inferiority are something that everyone
has, but staying in that condition is too heavy to endure
forever .
YOUTH:  Huh? This is getting pretty confusing.
PHILOSOPHER:  Okay , let’ s go over things one at a time. The
condition of having a feeling of inferiority is a condition of
feeling some sort of lack in oneself in the present situation. So
then, the question is—
YOUTH:  How do you fill in the part that’ s missing, right?
PHILOSOPHER:  Exactly . How to compensate for the part that is
lacking. The healthiest way is to try to compensate through
striving and growth. For instance, it could be by applying
oneself to one’ s studies, engaging in constant training or being
diligent in one’ s work. However , people who aren’ t equipped
with that courage end up stepping into an inferiority complex.
Again, it’ s thinking, I’m not well educated, so I can’ t succeed .
And it’ s implying your capability by saying, ‘If only I werewell educated, I could be really successful.’ That ‘the real me’,
which just happens to be obscured right now by the matter of
education, is superior .
YOUTH:  No, that doesn’ t make sense—the second thing you’re
saying is beyond being a feeling of inferiority . That’ s really
more bravado than anything else, isn’ t it?
PHILOSOPHER:  Indeed. The inferiority complex can also develop
into another special mental state.
YOUTH:  And what is that?
PHILOSOPHER:  I doubt you have heard much about it. It’ s the
‘superiority complex’.
YOUTH:  Superiority  complex?
PHILOSOPHER:  One is suf fering from strong feelings of
inferiority , and, on top of that, one doesn’ t have the courage to
compensate through healthy modes of striving and growth.
That being said, one can’ t tolerate the inferiority complex of
thinking, A is the situation, so  B cannot be done . One can’ t
accept ‘one’ s incapable self ’. At that point, the person thinks
of trying to compensate in some other fashion, and looks for
an easier way out.
YOUTH:  What way is that?
PHILOSOPHER:  It’ s to act as if one is indeed superior , and to
indulge in a fabricated feeling of superiority .
YOUTH:  A fabricated feeling of superiority?
PHILOSOPHER:  A familiar example would be ‘giving authority’.
YOUTH:  What does that mean?
PHILOSOPHER:  One makes a show of being on good terms with
a powerful person (broadly speaking—it could be anyone from
the leader of your school class to a famous celebrity). And by
doing that, one lets it be known that one is special. Behaviours
like misrepresenting one’ s work experience or excessive
allegiance to particular brands of clothing are forms of giving
authority , and probably also have aspects of the superiority
complex. In each case, it isn’ t that the ‘I’ is actually superior
or special. It is only that one is making the ‘I’ look superior bylinking it to authority . In short, it’ s a fabricated feeling of
superiority .
YOUTH:  And at the base of that, there is an intense feeling of
inferiority?
PHILOSOPHER:  Of course. I don’ t know much about fashion, but
I think it’ s advisable to think of people who wear rings with
rubies and emeralds on all their fingers as having issues with
feelings of inferiority , rather than issues of aesthetic
sensibility . In other words, they have signs of a superiority
complex.
YOUTH:  Right.
PHILOSOPHER:  But those who make themselves look bigger on
borrowed power are essentially living according to other
people’ s value systems—they are living other people’ s lives.
This is a point that must be emphasised.
YOUTH:  So, a superiority complex. That’ s a very interesting
psychology . Can you give me a dif ferent example?
PHILOSOPHER:  There’ s the kind of person who likes to boast
about his achievements. Someone who clings to his past glory ,
and is always recounting memories of the time when his light
shone brightest. Maybe you know some people like this. All
such people can be said to have superiority complexes.
YOUTH:  The kind of man who boasts about his achievements?
Y es, it is an arrogant attitude, but he can boast because he
actually is superior . Y ou can’ t call that a fabricated feeling of
superiority .
PHILOSOPHER:  Ah, but you are wrong. Those who go so far as
to boast about things out loud actually have no confidence in
themselves. As Adler clearly indicates, ‘The one who boasts
does so only out of a feeling of inferiority .’
YOUTH:  Y ou’re saying that boasting is an inverted feeling of
inferiority?
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right. If one really has confidence in
oneself, one doesn’ t feel the need to boast. It’ s because one’ s
feeling of inferiority is strong that one boasts. One feels the
need to flaunt one’ s superiority all the more. There’ s the fearthat if one doesn’ t do that, not a single person will accept one
‘the way I am’. This is a full-blown superiority complex.
YOUTH:  So, though one would think from the sound of the
words that inferiority complex and superiority complex were
polar opposites, in actuality they border on each other?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, they are clearly connected. Now , there is
one last example I’d like to give, a complex example that deals
with boasting. It is a pattern leading to a particular feeling of
superiority that manifests due to the feeling of inferiority itself
becoming intensified. Concretely speaking, it’ s bragging about
one’ s own misfortune.
YOUTH:  Bragging about one’ s own misfortune?
PHILOSOPHER:  The person who assumes a boasting manner
when talking about his upbringing and the like; the various
misfortunes that have rained down upon him. If someone
should try to comfort this person, or suggest some change be
made, he’ll refuse the helping hand by saying, ‘Y ou don’ t
understand how I feel.’
YOUTH:  W ell, there are people like that, but …
PHILOSOPHER:  Such people try to make themselves ‘special’ by
way of their experience of misfortune, and with the single fact
of their misfortune try to place themselves above others. T ake
the fact that I am short, for instance. Let’ s say that kind-
hearted people come up to me and say , ‘It’ s nothing to worry
about,’ or ‘Such things have nothing to do with human
values.’ Now , if I were to reject them and say , ‘Y ou think you
know what short people go through, huh?’, no one would say a
thing to me anymore. I’m sure that everyone around me would
start treating me just as if I were a boil about to burst, and
would handle me very carefully—or , should I say ,
circumspectly .
YOUTH:  Absolutely true.
PHILOSOPHER:  By doing that, my position becomes superior to
other people’ s, and I can become special. Quite a few people
try to be a ‘special being’ by adopting this kind of attitudewhen they are sick or injured, or suf fering the mental anguish
of heartbreak.
YOUTH:  So, they reveal their feeling of inferiority , and use it to
their advantage?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. They use their misfortune to their
advantage, and try to control the other party with it. By
declaring how unfortunate they are and how much they have
suf fered, they are trying to worry the people around them
(their family and friends, for example), and to restrict their
speech and behaviour , and control them. The people I was
talking about at the very beginning, who shut themselves up in
their rooms, frequently indulge in feelings of superiority that
use misfortune to their advantage. So much so that Adler
himself pointed out, ‘In our culture weakness can be quite
strong and powerful.’
YOUTH:  So, weakness is powerful?
PHILOSOPHER:  Adler says, ‘In fact, if we were to ask ourselves
who is the strongest person in our culture, the logical answer
would be the baby . The baby rules and cannot be dominated.’
The baby rules over the adults with his weakness. And it is
because of this weakness that no one can control him.
YOUTH:  I’ve never encountered that viewpoint.
PHILOSOPHER:  Of course, the words of the person who has been
hurt—‘Y ou don’ t understand how I feel’—are likely to contain
a certain degree of truth. Completely understanding the
feelings of the person who is suf fering is something that no
one is capable of. But as long as one continues to use one’ s
misfortune to one’ s advantage in order to be ‘special’, one will
always need that misfortune.
The youth and philosopher had now cover ed a series of
discussion topics: the feeling of inferiority , the inferiority
complex, and the superiority complex. Psychology
keywords though they clearly wer e, the truths they
contained differ ed gr eatly fr om the youth’ s imagined
meanings. Still, something didn’t feel right to him,
somehow . What is it about all this that I’m having a hard
time accepting? W ell, it must be the introductory part, thepremise, that is giving me doubts.  The youth calmly opened
his mouth to speak.L I F E  I S  N O T  A  C O M P E T I T I O N
YOUTH:  But, I guess I still don’ t really get it.
PHILOSOPHER:  Okay , ask me anything you like.
YOUTH:  Adler recognises that the pursuit of superiority—one’ s
trying to be a more superior being—is a universal desire,
doesn’ t he? On the other hand, he’ s striking a note of warning
with regard to excessive feelings of inferiority and superiority .
It’d be easy to understand if he could renounce the pursuit of
superiority—then I could accept it. What are we supposed to
do?
PHILOSOPHER:  Think about it this way . When we refer to the
pursuit of superiority , there’ s a tendency to think of it as the
desire to try to be superior to other people; as the desire to
climb higher , even if it means kicking others down—you
know , the image of ascending a stairway and pushing people
out of the way to get to the top. Adler does not uphold such
attitudes, of course. Rather , he’ s saying that on the same level
playing field, there are people who are moving forward, and
there are people who are moving forward behind them. Keep
that image in mind. Though the distance covered and the speed
of walking dif fer , everyone is walking equally in the same flat
place. The pursuit of superiority is the mindset of taking a
single step forward on one’ s own feet, not the mindset of
competition of the sort that necessitates aiming to be greater
than other people.
YOUTH:  So, life is not a competition?
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right. It’ s enough to just keep moving in a
forward direction, without competing with anyone. And, of
course, there is no need to compare oneself with others.
YOUTH:  No, that’ s impossible. W e’ll always compare ourselves
to other people, no matter what. That’ s exactly where our
feeling of inferiority comes from, isn’ t it?
PHILOSOPHER:  A healthy feeling of inferiority is not something
that comes from comparing oneself to others, but from one’ s
comparison with one’ s ideal self.YOUTH:  But …
PHILOSOPHER:  Look, all of us are dif ferent. Gender , age,
knowledge, experience, appearance—no two of us are exactly
the same. Let’ s acknowledge in a positive manner the fact that
other people are dif ferent from us. And that we are not the
same, but we are equal.
YOUTH:  W e are not the same, but we are equal?
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right. Everyone is dif ferent. Don’ t mix up
that dif ference with good and bad, and superior and inferior .
Whatever dif ferences we may have, we are all equal.
YOUTH:  No distinction of rank for people. Idealistically
speaking, I suppose so. But aren’ t we trying to have an honest
discussion about reality , now? W ould you really say , for
instance, that I, an adult, and a child who is still struggling
with his arithmetic, are equal?
PHILOSOPHER:  In terms of the amount of knowledge and
experience, and then the amount of responsibility that can be
taken, there are bound to be dif ferences. The child might not
be able to tie his shoes properly , or figure out complicated
mathematical equations, or be able to take the same degree of
responsibility as an adult when problems arise. However , such
things shouldn’ t have anything to do with human values. My
answer is the same. Human beings are all equal, but not the
same.
YOUTH:  Then, are you saying that a child should be treated like
a full-grown adult?
PHILOSOPHER:  No, instead of treating the child like an adult, or
like a child, one must treat them like a human being. One
interacts with the child with sincerity , as another human being
just like oneself.
YOUTH:  Let’ s change the question. All people are equal.
They’re on the same level playing field. But actually , there’ s a
disparity here, isn’ t there? Those who move forward are
superior , and those who pursue them from behind are inferior .
So, we end up at the problem of superior and inferior , don’ t
we?PHILOSOPHER:  No, we do not. It does not matter if one is trying
to walk in front of others or walk behind them. It is as if we
are moving through a flat space that has no vertical axis. W e
do not walk in order to compete with someone. It is in trying
to progress past who one is now that there is value.
YOUTH:  Have you become free from all forms of competition?
PHILOSOPHER:  Of course. I do not think about gaining status or
honour , and I live my life as an outsider philosopher without
any connection whatsoever to worldly competition.
YOUTH:  Does that mean you dropped out of competition? That
you somehow accepted defeat?
PHILOSOPHER:  No. I withdrew from places that are preoccupied
with winning and losing. When one is trying to be oneself,
competition will inevitably get in the way .
YOUTH:  No way! That’ s a tired-out old man’ s ar gument. Y oung
folks like me have to pull themselves up by their own
bootstraps amid the tension of competition. It’ s because I don’ t
have a rival running alongside me that I can’ t outdo myself.
What’ s wrong with thinking of interpersonal relationships as
competitive?
PHILOSOPHER:  If that rival was someone you could call a
comrade, it’ s possible that it would lead to self-improvement.
But, in many cases, a competitor will not be your comrade.
YOUTH:  Meaning what, exactly?Y O U ’ R E  T H E  O N L Y  O N E
W O R R Y I N G  A B O U T  Y O U R
A P P E A R A N C E
PHILOSOPHER:  Let’ s tie up the loose ends. At the outset, you
expressed dissatisfaction with Adler ’ s definition that all
problems are interpersonal relationship problems, right? That
was the basis for our discussion on feelings of inferiority .
YOUTH:  Y es, that’ s correct. The subject of feelings of
inferiority was too intense, and I was on the ver ge of for getting
that point. Why did you bring up the subject in the first place?
PHILOSOPHER:  It is connected with the subject of competition.
Please remember that. If there is competition at the core of a
person’ s interpersonal relationships, he will not be able to
escape interpersonal relationship problems or escape
misfortune.
YOUTH:  Why not?
PHILOSOPHER:  Because at the end of a competition, there are
winners and losers.
YOUTH:  It’ s perfectly fine to have winners and losers!
PHILOSOPHER:  Give some thought to it then, if it were you,
specifically , who had a consciousness of being in competition
with the people around you. In your relations with them, you
will have no choice but to be conscious of victory or defeat.
Mr A got into this famous university , Mr B found work at that
big company and Mr C has hooked up with such a nice-
looking woman—and you’ll compare yourself to them and
think, This is all I’ve got .
YOUTH:  Ha-ha. That’ s pretty specific.
PHILOSOPHER:  When one is conscious of competition and
victory and defeat, it is inevitable that feelings of inferiority
will arise. Because one is constantly comparing oneself to
others and thinking, I beat that person  or I lost to that person .
The inferiority complex and the superiority complex areextensions of that. Now , what kind of being do you think the
other person is to you, at that point?
YOUTH:  I don’ t know—a rival, I guess?
PHILOSOPHER:  No, not a mere rival. Before you know it, you
start to see each and every person, everyone in the whole
world, as your enemy .
YOUTH:  My enemy?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y ou start to think that people are always looking
down on you and treating you with scorn; that they’re all
enemies who must never be underestimated, who lie in wait
for any opening and attack at the drop of a hat. In short, that
the world is a terrifying place.
YOUTH:  Enemies who must never be underestimated … That’ s
who I’m in competition with?
PHILOSOPHER:  This is what is so terrifying about competition.
Even if you’re not a loser , even if you’re someone who keeps
on winning, if you are someone who has placed himself in
competition, you will never have a moment’ s peace. Y ou don’ t
want to be a loser . And you always have to keep on winning if
you don’ t want to be a loser . Y ou can’ t trust other people. The
reason that so many people don’ t really feel happy while
they’re building up their success in the eyes of society is that
they are living in competition. Because to them, the world is a
perilous place that is overflowing with enemies.
YOUTH:  I suppose so, but …
PHILOSOPHER:  But do other people actually look at you so
much? Are they really watching you around the clock, and
lying in wait for the perfect moment to attack? It seems rather
unlikely . A young friend of mine, when he was a teenager ,
used to spend a lot of time in front of the mirror arranging his
hair . And once, when he was doing that, his grandmother said,
‘Y ou’re the only one who’ s worried how you look.’ He says
that it got a bit easier for him to deal with life after that.
YOUTH:  Hey , that’ s a dig at me, isn’ t it? Sure, maybe I do see
the people around me as enemies. I’m constantly in fear of
being attacked, of the arrows that could come flying at me atany moment. I always think that I’m being watched by others,
that I’m being subjected to harsh judgement, and that I’m
going to be attacked. And it’ s probably true that this is a self-
conscious reaction, just like the mirror -obsessed teenager . The
people of the world aren’ t paying attention to me. Even if I
were to go walking on my hands down the street, they’d take
no notice! But, I don’ t know . Are you saying, after all, that my
feeling of inferiority is something that I chose; that has some
sort of goal? That just doesn’ t make any sense to me.
PHILOSOPHER:  And why is that?
YOUTH:  I have a brother who is three years older than I am. He
fits the classic image of the big brother—he always does what
our parents say , he excels in his studies and in sports, and he’ s
the very picture of diligence. And from the time I was little, I
was always compared to him. He is older and more advanced,
so of course I could never beat him at anything. Our parents
did not care at all about such circumstances, and never gave
me any sign of recognition. Whatever I did, I got treated like a
child, and I was berated at every opportunity and told to be
quiet. I learned to keep my feelings to myself. I’ve lived my
life totally steeped in feelings of inferiority , and I had no
choice but to be conscious of being in competition with my
brother!
PHILOSOPHER:  I see.
YOUTH:  Sometimes I think of it like this: I’m like a gourd that
grew without getting enough sun. So, it is only natural that I’m
all twisted up with feelings of inferiority . If there’ s anyone
who could grow straight in such a situation, well, I’d love to
meet them!
PHILOSOPHER:  I understand. I really do understand how you
feel. Now , let’ s look at ‘competition’ while taking into
consideration your relationship with your brother . If you didn’ t
think with a competition orientation, with regard to your
brother and your other interpersonal relationships, how would
people seem to you?
YOUTH:  W ell, my brother is my brother , and I guess other
people are another story .PHILOSOPHER:  No, they should become more positive
comrades.
YOUTH:  Comrades?
PHILOSOPHER:  Earlier , didn’ t you say , ‘I can’ t celebrate other
people’ s happiness with all my heart’? Y ou think of
interpersonal relationships as competition; you perceive other
people’ s happiness as ‘my defeat’, and that is why you can’ t
celebrate it. However , once one is released from the schema of
competition, the need to triumph over someone disappears.
One is also released from the fear that says, Maybe I will lose .
And one becomes able to celebrate other people’ s happiness
with all one’ s heart. One may become able to contribute
actively to other people’ s happiness. The person who always
has the will to help another in times of need—that is someone
who may properly be called your comrade.
YOUTH:  Hmm.
PHILOSOPHER:  Now we come to the important part. When you
are able to truly feel that ‘people are my comrades’, your way
of looking at the world will change utterly . No longer will you
think of the world as a perilous place, or be plagued by
needless doubts; the world will appear before you as a safe and
pleasant place. And your interpersonal relationship problems
will decrease dramatically .
YOUTH:  What a happy person you are! But you know , that’ s all
like a sunflower . It’ s the reasoning of a sunflower that is
bathed in full sunshine every day , and nurtured with ample
watering. A gourd grown in the dim shade doesn’ t do so well!
PHILOSOPHER:  Y ou are returning to aetiology (the attributing of
causes) again.
YOUTH:  Oh yes, I sure am!
Raised by strict par ents, the youth had been oppr essed and
compar ed to his elder br other ever since childhood. None
of his opinions wer e ever heard, and he was subjected to
the violent words that he was a poor excuse for a little
br other . Unable to make friends even at school, he spent all
his br eak time alone in the library , which became his soleplace of r efuge. This youth who had passed his early years
in such a way was truly an inhabitant of aetiology . If he
had not been raised by those par ents; if that elder br other
had never existed; and if he had not attended that school,
he could have had a brighter life. The youth had been
trying to participate in the discussion as cool-headedly as
possible, but now his many years of pent-up feelings came
bursting out.F R O M  P O W E R  S T R U G G L E  T O
R E V E N G E
YOUTH:  Okay , all this talk about teleology and such is pure
sophistry , and trauma definitely does exist. And people cannot
break free from the past. Surely you realise that? W e cannot go
back to the past in a time machine. As long as the past exists
as the past, we live within contexts from the past. If one were
to treat the past as something that does not exist, that would be
the same as negating the entire life one has led. Are you
suggesting I choose such an irresponsible life?
PHILOSOPHER:  It is true that one cannot use a time machine or
turn back the hands of time. But what kind of meaning does
one attribute to past events? This is the task that is given to
‘you now’.
YOUTH:  All right, so let’ s talk about ‘now’. Last time, you said
that people fabricate the emotion of anger , right? And that that
is the standpoint of teleology . I still cannot accept that
statement. For example, how would you explain instances of
anger toward society , or anger toward government? W ould you
say that these, too, are emotions fabricated in order to push
one’ s opinions?
PHILOSOPHER:  Certainly , there are times when I feel indignation
with regard to social problems. But I would say that rather
than a sudden burst of emotion, it is indignation based on
logic. There is a dif ference between personal anger (personal
grudge) and indignation with regard to society’ s contradictions
and injustices (righteous indignation). Personal anger soon
cools. Righteous indignation, on the other hand, lasts for a
long time. Anger as an expression of a personal grudge is
nothing but a tool for making others submit to you.
YOUTH:  Y ou say that personal grudges and righteous
indignation are dif ferent?
PHILOSOPHER:  They are completely dif ferent. Because righteous
indignation goes beyond one’ s own interests.YOUTH:  Then, I’ll ask about personal grudges. Surely even you
get angry sometimes—for instance, if someone hurls abuse at
you for no particular reason—don’ t you?
PHILOSOPHER:  No, I do not.
YOUTH:  Come on, be honest.
PHILOSOPHER:  If someone were to abuse me to my face, I
would think about the person’ s hidden goal. Even if you are
not directly abusive, when you feel genuinely angry due to
another person’ s words or behaviour , please consider that the
person is challenging you to a power struggle.
YOUTH:  A power struggle?
PHILOSOPHER:  For instance, a child will tease an adult with
various pranks and misbehaviours. In many cases, this is
something done with the goal of getting attention, and will
cease just before the adult gets genuinely angry . However , if
the child does not stop before the adult gets genuinely angry ,
then his goal is actually to get in a fight.
YOUTH:  Why would he want to get in a fight?
PHILOSOPHER:  He wants to win. He wants to prove his power
by winning.
YOUTH:  I don’ t really get that. Could you give me some
concrete examples?
PHILOSOPHER:  Let’ s say you and a friend have been discussing
the current political situation. Before long, it turns into a
heated ar gument, and neither of you is willing to accept any
dif ferences of opinion until finally it reaches the point where
he starts engaging in personal attacks—that you’re stupid, and
it’ s because of people like you that this country doesn’ t
change; that sort of thing.
YOUTH:  But if someone said that to me, I wouldn’ t be able to
put up with it.
PHILOSOPHER:  In this case, what is the other person’ s goal? Is it
only that he wants to discuss politics? No, it isn’ t. It’ s that he
finds you unbearable, and he wants to criticise and provoke
you, and make you submit through a power struggle. If you getangry at this point, the moment he has been anticipating will
arrive, and the relationship will suddenly turn into a power
struggle. No matter what the provocation, you must not get
taken in.
YOUTH:  No, there’ s no need to run away from it. If someone
wants to start a fight, it’ s fine to accept it. Because it’ s the
other guy who’ s at fault, anyway . Y ou can bash his nose in, the
stupid fool. W ith words, that is.
PHILOSOPHER:  Now , let’ s say you take control of the quarrel.
And then the other man, who was seeking to defeat you,
withdraws in a sportsmanlike manner . The thing is, the power
struggle doesn’ t end there. Having lost the dispute, he rushes
onto the next stage.
YOUTH:  The next stage?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. It’ s the revenge stage. Though he has
withdrawn for the time being, he will be scheming some
revenge in another place and another form, and will reappear
with an act of retaliation.
YOUTH:  Like what, for instance?
PHILOSOPHER:  The child oppressed by his parents will turn to
delinquency . He’ll stop going to school. He’ll cut his wrists or
engage in other acts of self-harm. In Freudian aetiology , this is
regarded as simple cause and ef fect: the parents raised the
child in this way , and that is why the child grew up to be like
this. It’ s just like pointing out that a plant wasn’ t watered, so it
withered. It’ s an interpretation that is certainly easy to
understand. But Adlerian teleology does not turn a blind eye to
the goal that the child is hiding. That is to say , the goal of
revenge on the parents. If he becomes a delinquent, stops
going to school, cuts his wrists or things like that, the parents
will be upset. They’ll panic and worry themselves sick over
him. It is in the knowledge that this will happen that the child
engages in problem behaviour . So that the current goal
(revenge on the parents) can be realised, not because he is
motivated by past causes (home environment).
YOUTH:  He engages in problem behaviour in order to upset his
parents?PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right. There are probably a lot of people
who feel mystified by seeing a child who cuts his wrists, and
think, Why would he do such a thing?  But try to think how the
people around the child—the parents, for instance—will feel
as a result of the behaviour of wrist-cutting. If you do, the goal
behind the behaviour should come into view of its own accord.
YOUTH:  The goal being revenge?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. And once the interpersonal relationship
reaches the revenge stage, it is almost impossible for either
party to find a solution. T o prevent this from happening, when
one is challenged to a power struggle, one must never allow
oneself to be taken in.A D M I T T I N G  F A U L T  I S  N O T
D E F E A T
YOUTH:  All right, then what should you do when you’re
subjected to personal attacks right to your face? Do you just
grin and bear it?
PHILOSOPHER:  No, the idea that you are ‘bearing it’ is proof that
you are still stuck in the power struggle. When you are
challenged to a fight, and you sense that it is a power struggle,
step down from the conflict as soon as possible. Do not answer
his action with a reaction. That is the only thing we can do.
YOUTH:  But is it really that easy to not respond to provocation?
In the first place, how would you say I should control my
anger?
PHILOSOPHER:  When you control your anger , you’re ‘bearing
it’, right? Instead, let’ s learn a way to settle things without
using the emotion of anger . Because after all, anger is a tool. A
means for achieving a goal.
YOUTH:  That’ s a tough one.
PHILOSOPHER:  The first thing that I want you to understand here
is the fact that anger is a form of communication, and that
communication is nevertheless possible without using anger .
W e can convey our thoughts and intentions and be accepted
without any need for anger . If you learn to understand this
experientially , the anger emotion will stop appearing, all on its
own.
YOUTH:  But what if they come at you with mistaken
accusations, or make insulting comments? I shouldn’ t get
angry even then?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y ou don’ t seem to understand yet. It’ s not that
you mustn’ t get angry , but that there is no need to rely on the
tool of anger . Irascible people do not have short tempers—it is
only that they do not know that there are ef fective
communication tools other than anger . That is why people endup saying things like ‘I just snapped’ or ‘he flew into a rage’.
W e end up relying on anger to communicate.
YOUTH:  Ef fective communication tools other than anger …
PHILOSOPHER:  W e have language. W e can communicate
through language. Believe in the power of language, and the
language of logic.
YOUTH:  Certainly , if I did not believe in that, we wouldn’ t be
having this dialogue.
PHILOSOPHER:  One more thing about power struggles. In every
instance, no matter how much you might think you are right,
try not to criticise the other party on that basis. This is an
interpersonal relationship trap that many people fall into.
YOUTH:  Why’ s that?
PHILOSOPHER:  The moment one is convinced that ‘I am right’ in
an interpersonal relationship, one has already stepped into a
power struggle.
YOUTH:  Just because you think you’re right? No way , that’ s just
blowing things all out of proportion.
PHILOSOPHER:  I am right. That is to say , the other party is
wrong. At that point, the focus of the discussion shifts from
‘the rightness of the assertions’ to ‘the state of the
interpersonal relationship’. In other words, the conviction that
‘I am right’ leads to the assumption that ‘this person is wrong’,
and finally it becomes a contest and you are thinking, I have to
win . It’ s a power struggle through and through.
YOUTH:  Hmm.
PHILOSOPHER:  In the first place, the rightness of one’ s
assertions has nothing to do with winning or losing. If you
think you are right, regardless of what other people’ s opinions
might be, the matter should be closed then and there.
However , many people will rush into a power struggle, and try
to make others submit to them. And that is why they think of
‘admitting a mistake’ as ‘admitting defeat’.
YOUTH:  Y es, there definitely is that aspect.PHILOSOPHER:  Because of one’ s mindset of not wanting to lose,
one is unable to admit one’ s mistake, the result being that one
ends up choosing the wrong path. Admitting mistakes,
conveying words of apology , and stepping down from power
struggles—none of these things is defeat. The pursuit of
superiority is not something that is carried out through
competition with other people.
YOUTH:  So, when you’re hung up on winning and losing, you
lose the ability to make the right choices?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. It clouds your judgement, and all you can
see is imminent victory or defeat. Then you turn down the
wrong path. It’ s only when we take away the lenses of
competition and winning and losing that we can begin to
correct and change ourselves.O V E R C O M I N G  T H E  T A S K S  T H A T
F A C E  Y O U  I N  L I F E
YOUTH:  Okay , but there’ s still a problem. It’ s the statement ‘all
problems are interpersonal relationship problems’. I can see
that the feeling of inferiority is an interpersonal relationship
worry , and that it has certain ef fects on us. And I accept as
logical the idea that life is not a competition. I cannot see other
people as comrades, and somewhere inside me I think of them
as enemies. This is clearly the case. But the thing I find
puzzling is, why does Adler place so much importance on
interpersonal relationships? Why does he go so far as to say
‘all’ of them?
PHILOSOPHER:  The issue of interpersonal relationships is so
important that no matter how broadly it is addressed, it never
seems to suf fice. Last time I told you, ‘What you are lacking is
the courage to be happy .’ Y ou remember that, right?
YOUTH:  I couldn’ t for get it if I tried.
PHILOSOPHER:  So, why do you see other people as enemies, and
why can’ t you think of them as your comrades? It is because
you have lost your courage and you are running away from
your ‘life tasks’.
YOUTH:  My life tasks?
PHILOSOPHER:  Right. This is a crucial point. In Adlerian
psychology , clear objectives are laid out for human behaviour
and psychology .
YOUTH:  What sort of objectives?
PHILOSOPHER:  First, there are two objectives for behaviour: to
be self-reliant and to live in harmony with society . Then, the
objectives for the psychology that supports these behaviours
are the consciousness that I have the ability  and the
consciousness that people ar e my comrades .
YOUTH:  Just a moment. I’m writing this down … There are the
following two objectives for behaviour: to be self-reliant and
to live in harmony with society . And there are the followingtwo objectives for the psychology that supports these
behaviours: the consciousness that I have the ability  and the
consciousness that people ar e my comrades  … Okay , I can see
that it is a crucial subject: to be self-reliant as an individual
while living in harmony with people and society . It seems to
tie in with everything we’ve been discussing.
PHILOSOPHER:  And these objectives can be achieved by facing
what Adler calls ‘life tasks’.
YOUTH:  Then, what are life tasks?
PHILOSOPHER:  Let’ s think of the word ‘life’ as tracing back to
childhood. During childhood, we are protected by our parents
and can live without needing to work. But eventually , the time
comes when one has to be self-reliant. One cannot be
dependent on one’ s parents forever , and one has to be self-
reliant mentally , of course, and self-reliant in a social sense as
well, and one has to engage in some form of work—which is
not limited to the narrow definition of working at a company .
Furthermore, in the process of growing up, one begins to have
all kinds of friend relationships. Of course, one may form a
love relationship with someone that may even lead to
marriage. If it does, one will start a marital relationship, and if
one has children, a parent–child relationship will begin. Adler
made three categories of the interpersonal relationships that
arise out of these processes. He referred to them as ‘tasks of
work’, ‘tasks of friendship’ and ‘tasks of love’, and all
together as ‘life tasks’.
YOUTH:  Are these tasks the obligations one has as a member of
society? In other words, things like labour and payment of
taxes?
PHILOSOPHER:  No, please think of this solely in terms of
interpersonal relationships. That is, the distance and depth in
one’ s interpersonal relationships. Adler sometimes used the
expression ‘three social ties’ to emphasise the point.
YOUTH:  The distance and depth in one’ s interpersonal
relationships?
PHILOSOPHER:  The interpersonal relationships that a single
individual has no choice but to confront when attempting tolive as a social being—these are the life tasks. They are indeed
tasks in the sense that one has no choice but to confront them.
YOUTH:  W ould you be more specific?
PHILOSOPHER:  First, let’ s look at the tasks of work. Regardless
of the kind of work, there is no work that can be completed all
by oneself. For instance, I am usually here in my study writing
manuscripts for a book. W riting is completely autonomous
work that I cannot have someone else do for me. But then
there is the presence of the editor and many others, without
whose assistance the work would not be realised, from the
people who handle book design and printing, to the
distribution and bookstore staf f. W ork that can be completed
without the cooperation of other people is in principle
unfeasible.
YOUTH:  Broadly speaking, I suppose so.
PHILOSOPHER:  However , considered from the viewpoint of
distance and depth, interpersonal relationships of work may be
said to have the lowest hurdles. Interpersonal relationships of
work have the easy-to-understand common objective of
obtaining good results, so people can cooperate even if they
don’ t always get along, and to some extent they have no
choice but to cooperate. And as long as a relationship is
formed solely on the basis of work, it will go back to being a
relationship with an outsider when working hours are over or
one changes jobs.
YOUTH:  Y es, so true.
PHILOSOPHER:  And the ones who get tripped up in the
interpersonal relationships at this stage are the people referred
to as ‘NEET s’ [a young person not in education, employment
or training] or ‘shut-ins’ [a person confined indoors].
YOUTH:  Huh? W ait a minute! Are you saying that they don’ t try
to work simply because they want to avoid the interpersonal
relationships that are associated with work, not that they don’ t
want to work or that they’re refusing to do manual labour?
PHILOSOPHER:  Putting aside the question of whether or not they
are conscious of it themselves, interpersonal relationships areat the core. For example, a man sends out résumés to find
work and gets interviews, only to be rejected by one company
after another . It hurts his pride. He starts to wonder what the
purpose in working is if he has to go through such things. Or
he makes a big mistake at work. The company is going to lose
a huge sum of money because of him. Feeling utterly hopeless,
as if he’ s plunged into darkness, he can’ t bear the thought of
coming into work the following day . None of these are
examples of the work itself becoming disagreeable. What is
disagreeable is being criticised or rebuked by others through
the work, getting labelled as having no ability or being
incompetent or unsuited to the work, and hurting the dignity of
one’ s irreplaceable self. In other words, everything is an
interpersonal relationship issue.R E D  S T R I N G  A N D  R I G I D
C H A I N S
YOUTH:  W ell, I’ll save my objections for later . Next, what
about the task of friendship?
PHILOSOPHER:  This is a friend relationship in a broader sense,
away from work, as there is none of the compulsion of the
workplace. It is a relationship that is dif ficult to initiate or
deepen.
YOUTH:  Ah, you’ve got that right! If there’ s a space, like one’ s
school or workplace, one can still build a relationship. But
then it would be a superficial relationship that is limited to that
space. T o even attempt to initiate a personal friend
relationship, or find a friend in a place outside the school or
workplace, would be extremely dif ficult.
PHILOSOPHER:  Do you have anyone who you would call a close
friend?
YOUTH:  I have a friend. But I’m not sure I’d call him a close
friend …
PHILOSOPHER:  It used to be the same for me. When I was in
high school, I did not even try to make friends, and spent my
days studying Greek and German, quietly absorbed in reading
philosophy books. My mother was worried about me and went
to consult my homeroom teacher . And my teacher told her ,
‘There’ s no need to worry . He’ s a person who doesn’ t need
friends.’ Those words were very encouraging to my mother ,
and to me as well.
YOUTH:  A person who doesn’ t need friends? So, in high school
you didn’ t have a single friend?
PHILOSOPHER:  No, I did have one friend. He said, ‘There’ s
nothing really worth learning at a university ,’ and in the end he
actually did not enter university . He went into seclusion up in
the mountains for several years, and these days I hear he’ s
working in journalism in Southeast Asia. I haven’ t seen him in
decades, but I have the feeling that if we got together again,we’d be able to hang out just as we did back then. A lot of
people think that the more friends you have the better , but I’m
not so sure about that. There’ s no value at all in the number of
friends or acquaintances you have. And this is a subject that
connects with the task of love, but what we should be thinking
about is the distance and depth of the relationship.
YOUTH:  W ill it be possible for me to make close friends?
PHILOSOPHER:  Of course it will. If you change, those around
you will change too. They will have no choice but to change.
Adlerian psychology is a psychology for changing oneself, not
a psychology for changing others. Instead of waiting for others
to change or waiting for the situation to change, you take the
first step forward yourself.
YOUTH:  Hmm …
PHILOSOPHER:  The fact is that you came like this to visit me in
my room. And, in you, I have found a young friend.
YOUTH:  I am your friend?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, because you are. The dialogue going on
here is not counselling, and we do not have a work
relationship. T o me, you are an irreplaceable friend. Don’ t you
think so?
YOUTH:  I’m your … irreplaceable friend? No, I won’ t think
anything about that right now . Let’ s just keep going. What
about the last one, the task of love?
PHILOSOPHER:  Think of it as divided into two stages: one, what
are known as love relationships; and two, relationships with
family , in particular parent–child relationships. W e have
discussed work and friendship, but, of the three tasks, most
likely it is the task of love that is the most dif ficult. When a
friend relationship has turned into love, speech and conduct
that was permitted between friends may no longer be
permitted the moment they become lovers. Specifically , that
would mean not permitting socialising with friends of the
opposite sex, and in some cases just speaking on the telephone
to someone of the opposite sex is enough to arouse jealousy .
The distance is that close, and the relationship that deep.YOUTH:  Y es, I suppose it can’ t be helped.
PHILOSOPHER:  But Adler does not accept restricting one’ s
partner . If the person seems to be happy , one can frankly
celebrate that condition. That is love. Relationships in which
people restrict each other eventually fall apart.
YOUTH:  W ait, that’ s an ar gument that can only lead to af firming
infidelity . Because if one’ s partner were happily having an
af fair , you’re saying that one should celebrate even that.
PHILOSOPHER:  No, I am not af firming someone having an af fair .
Think about it this way: the kind of relationship that feels
somehow oppressive and strained when the two people are
together cannot be called love, even if there is passion. When
one can think, Whenever I am with this person, I can behave
very fr eely , one can really feel love. One can be in a calm and
quite natural state, without having feelings of inferiority or
being beset with the need to flaunt one’ s superiority . That is
what real love is like. Restriction, on the other hand, is a
manifestation of the mindset of attempting to control one’ s
partner , and also an idea founded on a sense of distrust. Being
in the same space with someone who distrusts you isn’ t a
natural situation that one can put up with, is it? As Adler says,
‘If two people want to live together on good terms, they must
treat each other as equal personalities.’
YOUTH:  Okay .
PHILOSOPHER:  However , in love relationships and marital
relationships, there is the option of separating. So, even a
husband and wife who have been together for many years can
separate if continuing the relationship becomes distressful. In a
parent–child relationship, however , in principle this cannot be
done. If romantic love is a relationship connected by red
string, then the relationship between parents and children is
bound in rigid chains. And a pair of small scissors is all you
have. This is the dif ficulty of the parent–child relationship.
YOUTH:  So, what can one do?
PHILOSOPHER:  What I can say at this stage is: you must not run
away . No matter how distressful the relationship, you must not
avoid or put of f dealing with it. Even if in the end you’regoing to cut it with scissors, first you have to face it. The worst
thing to do is to just stand still with the situation as it is. It is
fundamentally impossible for a person to live life completely
alone, and it is only in social contexts that the person becomes
an ‘individual’. That is why in Adlerian psychology , self-
reliance as an individual and cooperation within society are
put forth as overarching objectives. Then, how can one
achieve these objectives? On this point, Adler speaks of
surmounting the three tasks of work, friendship and love; the
tasks of the interpersonal relationships that a living person has
no choice but to confront.
The youth was still struggling to grasp their true meaning.D O N ’ T  F A L L  F O R  T H E  ‘ L I F E - L I E ’
YOUTH:  Ah, it’ s getting confusing again. Y ou said that I see
other people as enemies and can’ t think of them as comrades,
because I’m running away from my life tasks. What was that
supposed to mean, anyway?
PHILOSOPHER:  Suppose, for instance, that there is a certain Mr
A whom you don’ t like. Because he has some flaws that are
hard to for give.
YOUTH:  Ha-ha, if we’re looking for people I don’ t like, there’ s
no shortage of candidates.
PHILOSOPHER:  But it isn’ t that you dislike Mr A because you
can’ t for give his flaws. Y ou had the goal of taking a dislike to
Mr A beforehand, and then started looking for the flaws to
satisfy that goal.
YOUTH:  That’ s ridiculous! Why would I do that?
PHILOSOPHER:  So that you could avoid an interpersonal
relationship with Mr A.
YOUTH:  No way , that’ s completely out of the question. It’ s
obvious that the order of things is backwards. He did
something I didn’ t like, that’ s why . If he hadn’ t, I’d have no
reason for taking a dislike to him.
PHILOSOPHER:  No, you are wrong. It’ s easy to see if you think
back on the example of separating from a person whom one
has been in a love relationship with. In relationships between
lovers or married couples, there are times when, after a certain
point, one becomes exasperated with everything one’ s partner
says or does. For instance, she doesn’ t care for the way he
eats; his slovenly appearance at home fills her with revulsion,
and even his snoring sets her of f. Even though until a few
months ago, none of it had ever bothered her before.
YOUTH:  Y es, that sounds familiar .
PHILOSOPHER:  The person feels this way because at some stage
she has resolved to herself, I want to end this r elationship , and
she has been looking around for the material with which to endit. The other person hasn’ t changed at all. It is her own goal
that has changed. Look, people are extremely selfish creatures
who are capable of finding any number of flaws and
shortcomings in others whenever the mood strikes them. A
man of perfect character could come along, and one would
have no dif ficulty in digging up some reason to dislike him.
That’ s exactly why the world can become a perilous place at
any time, and it’ s always possible to see everyone as one’ s
enemies.
YOUTH:  So, I am making up flaws in other people just so that I
can avoid my life tasks, and more, so I can avoid interpersonal
relationships? And I am running away by thinking of other
people as my enemies?
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right. Adler indicated the state of coming
up with all manner of pretexts in order to avoid the life tasks,
and called it the ‘life-lie’.
YOUTH:  Okay …
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, it’ s a severe term. One shifts one’ s
responsibility for the situation one is currently in to someone
else. One is running away from one’ s life tasks by saying that
everything is the fault of other people, or the fault of one’ s
environment. It’ s exactly the same as with the story I
mentioned earlier about the female student with the fear of
blushing. One lies to oneself, and one lies to the people around
one, too. When you really think about it, it’ s a pretty severe
term.
YOUTH:  But how can you conclude that I am lying? Y ou don’ t
know anything about what kind of people I have around me, or
what kind of life I lead, do you?
PHILOSOPHER:  T rue, I don’ t know anything about your past. Not
about your parents, or your elder brother either . I know only
one thing.
YOUTH:  What’ s that?
PHILOSOPHER:  The fact that you are the one who decided your
lifestyle, and no one else.
YOUTH:  Ar gh!PHILOSOPHER:  If your lifestyle were determined by other people
or your environment, it would certainly be possible to shift
responsibility . But we choose our lifestyles ourselves. It’ s clear
where the responsibility lies.
YOUTH:  So, you’re out to condemn me. But you’re calling
people liars and cowards. And saying that everyone is my
responsibility .
PHILOSOPHER:  Y ou must not use the power of anger to look
away . This is a very important point. Adler never discusses the
life tasks or life-lies in terms of good and evil. It is not morals
or good and evil that we should be discussing, but the issue of
courage.
YOUTH:  Courage again!
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. Even if you are avoiding your life tasks and
clinging to your life-lies, it isn’ t because you are steeped in
evil. It is not an issue to be condemned from a moralistic
standpoint. It is only an issue of courage.F R O M  T H E  P S Y C H O L O G Y  O F
P O S S E S S I O N  T O  T H E
P S Y C H O L O G Y  O F  P R A C T I C E
YOUTH:  So, in the end what you’re talking about is courage?
That reminds me, last time you said that Adlerian psychology
is a ‘psychology of courage’.
PHILOSOPHER:  I will add to that by saying that Adlerian
psychology is not a ‘psychology of possession’, but a
‘psychology of use’.
YOUTH:  So, it’ s that statement: ‘It’ s not what one is born with,
but what use one makes of that equipment.’
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right. Thank you for remembering it.
Freudian aetiology is a psychology of possession, and
eventually arrives at determinism. Adlerian psychology , on the
other hand, is a psychology of use, and it is you who decides
it.
YOUTH:  Adlerian psychology is a psychology of courage, and
at the same time it is a psychology of use …
PHILOSOPHER:  W e humans are not so fragile as to simply be at
the mercy of aetiological (cause and ef fect) traumas. From the
standpoint of teleology , we choose our lives and our lifestyles
ourselves. W e have the power to do that.
YOUTH:  But, honestly , I do not have the confidence to
overcome my inferiority complex. And you might say that
that’ s a life-lie, but I probably won’ t ever be able to break free
from the inferiority complex.
PHILOSOPHER:  Why don’ t you think so?
YOUTH:  Maybe what you are saying is right. Actually , I’m sure
it is, and courage really is what I am lacking. I can accept the
life-lie as well. I am scared of interacting with people. I don’ t
want to get hurt in interpersonal relationships, and I want to
put of f my life tasks. That’ s why I have all these excuses
ready . Y es, it’ s exactly as you say . But isn’ t what you aretalking about a kind of spiritualism? All you’re really saying
is, ‘Y ou’ve lost your courage, you’ve got to pluck up your
courage.’ It’ s no dif ferent from the silly instructor who thinks
he’ s giving you advice when he comes up and slaps you on the
shoulder and says, ‘Cheer up.’ Even though the reason I’m not
doing well is because I can’ t just cheer up!
PHILOSOPHER:  So, what you are saying is that you would like
me to suggest some specific steps?
YOUTH:  Y es, please. I am a human being. I am not a machine.
I’ve been told that I’m all out of courage, but I can’ t just get a
refill of courage as if I were filling up my tank with fuel.
PHILOSOPHER:  All right. But we’ve gone quite late again
tonight, so let’ s continue this next time.
YOUTH:  Y ou aren’ t running away from it, right?
PHILOSOPHER:  Of course not. Next time, we will probably
discuss freedom.
YOUTH:  Not courage?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, it will be a discussion of freedom, which is
essential when talking about courage. Please give some
thought to the matter of what freedom is.
YOUTH:  What freedom is … Fine. I am looking forward to next
time.T wo anguished weeks later , the youth paid another visit to
the philosopher ’ s study . What is freedom? Why can’ t people
be free? Why can’ t I be free? What is the true nature of
whatever it is that is constraining me?  The assignment he
had been given was weighing heavily on him, but it seemed
impossible to find a convincing answer . The mor e he
thought about it, the mor e the youth began to notice his
own lack of fr eedom.D E N Y  T H E  D E S I R E  F O R
R E C O G N I T I O N
YOUTH:  So, you said that today we would discuss freedom.
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. Did you have any time to think about what
freedom is?
YOUTH:  Y es, actually . I thought about it at great length.
PHILOSOPHER:  And did you arrive at any conclusions?
YOUTH:  W ell, I couldn’ t find any answers. But I did find this—
it’ s not my own idea, but something I came across at the
library , a line from a novel by Dostoevsky: ‘Money is coined
freedom.’ What do you think? Isn’ t ‘coined freedom’ a rather
refreshing term? But seriously , I was fascinated to find this
one line that drove right to the heart of this thing called money .
PHILOSOPHER:  I see. Certainly , if one were to speak in a very
general sense of the true nature of that which is brought about
by money , one might say that is freedom. It is an astute
observation, to be sure. But you wouldn’ t go so far as to say
‘freedom therefore is money’, would you?
YOUTH:  It’ s exactly as you say . There probably is freedom that
can be gained by way of money . And I’m sure that freedom is
greater than we imagine. Because, in reality , all the necessities
of life are dealt with through financial transactions. Does it
follow , then, that if one possesses great wealth, one can be
free? I don’ t believe that is the case; I would certainly like to
believe that it is not the case, and that human values and
human happiness cannot be bought with money .
PHILOSOPHER:  W ell, say for the moment that you have obtained
financial freedom. And then, though you have gained great
wealth, you have not found happiness. At that time, what
problems and privations would remain for you?
YOUTH:  It would be the interpersonal relationships you have
been mentioning. I have thought deeply about this matter . For
instance, you might be blessed by great wealth, but not have
anyone who loves you; you have no comrades whom youcould call friends, and you are not liked by anyone. This is a
great misfortune. Another thing I can’ t get out of my head is
the word ‘bonds’. Every one of us is tangled up and writhing
in these strings that we call bonds. Having to be attached to a
person you don’ t even care for , for example, or to always
watch out for your awful boss’ s mood swings. Imagine, if you
could be released from such petty interpersonal relationships,
how easy things would be! But no one can really do such a
thing. Wherever we go, we are surrounded by other people,
and we are social individuals, who exist in our relations to
other people. No matter what we do, we cannot escape the
strong rope of our interpersonal relationships. I see now that
Adler ’ s statement, ‘All problems are interpersonal relationship
problems,’ is a great insight.
PHILOSOPHER:  It is a crucial point. Let’ s dig a little deeper .
What is it about our interpersonal relationships that is robbing
us of our freedom?
YOUTH:  Last time, you spoke about whether one thinks of other
people as enemies or as comrades. Y ou said that if one
becomes able to see others as one’ s comrades, one’ s way of
looking at the world should change as well. That certainly
makes sense. I felt quite convinced the other day when I left
here. But, then what happened? I gave the matter some careful
thought, and I noticed that there are aspects of interpersonal
relationships that can’ t be completely explained.
PHILOSOPHER:  Like what?
YOUTH:  The most obvious one is the existence of parents. I
could never think of parents as enemies. During my childhood,
especially , they were my greatest guardians who raised and
protected me. In that regard, I am sincerely grateful. Still, my
parents were strict people. I told you about this last time, that
they always compared me to my older brother and refused to
recognise me. And they have constantly made comments about
my life, saying I should study more, not make friends with
people like this or that, get into this university at the very least,
get this kind of job, and so on. Their demands put a lot of
pressure on me, and were certainly bonds.
PHILOSOPHER:  Then, what did you end up doing?YOUTH:  It seems to me that until I started university , I was
never able to ignore my parents’ intentions. I was anxious,
which was unpleasant, but the fact of the matter is that my
wishes always seemed to end up overlapping with my
parents’. My place of work I chose myself, however .
PHILOSOPHER:  Now that you mention it, I haven’ t heard about
that yet. What kind of work do you do?
YOUTH:  I’m now working as a librarian at a university library .
My parents wanted me to take on my father ’ s printing plant,
like my brother did. Because of this, ever since I started my
current job, our relationship has been somewhat strained. If
they weren’ t my parents, and instead were enemy-like
presences in my life, I probably wouldn’ t have minded at all.
Because no matter how much they might have tried to
interfere, I could always just ignore them. But as I’ve said,
parents to me are not enemies. Whether or not they are
comrades is another matter , but, at the very least, they are not
what I would call enemies. It’ s a relationship that is much too
close to be able to just ignore their intentions.
PHILOSOPHER:  When you decided which university you would
go to in line with your parents’ wishes, what sort of emotion
did you feel with regard to your parents?
YOUTH:  It’ s complicated. I did have feelings of resentment, but,
on the other hand, there was this sense of relief, too. Y ou
know , that I could get them to recognise me if I went to that
school.
PHILOSOPHER:  Y ou could get them to recognise you?
YOUTH:  Come on, let’ s stop the roundabout leading questions.
I’m sure you know what I’m referring to. It’ s the so-called
‘desire for recognition’. It’ s interpersonal relationship
problems in a nutshell. W e human beings live in constant need
of recognition from others. It is precisely because the other
person is not an abhorrent enemy that one wants recognition
from him, isn’ t it? So yes, that’ s right; I wanted to be
recognised by my parents.
PHILOSOPHER:  I see. Let’ s talk about one of the major premises
of Adlerian psychology regarding this matter . Adlerianpsychology denies the need to seek recognition from others.
YOUTH:  It denies the desire for recognition?
PHILOSOPHER:  There is no need to be recognised by others.
Actually , one must not seek recognition. This point cannot be
overstated.
YOUTH:  No way! Isn’ t desire for recognition a truly universal
desire that motivates all human beings?D O  N O T  L I V E  T O  S A T I S F Y  T H E
E X P E C T A T I O N S  O F  O T H E R S
PHILOSOPHER:  Being recognised by others is certainly
something to be happy about. But it would be wrong to say
that being recognised is absolutely necessary . For what does
one seek recognition in the first place? Or , to put it more
succinctly , why does one want to be praised by others?
YOUTH:  It’ s simple. It’ s through being recognised by others that
each of us can truly feel we have value. It is through
recognition from others that one becomes able to wipe away
one’ s feelings of inferiority . One learns to have confidence in
oneself. Y es, it’ s an issue of value. I think you mentioned it
last time: that the feeling of inferiority is an issue of value
judgement. It’ s because I could never get recognition from my
parents that I have lived a life tainted by feelings of inferiority .
PHILOSOPHER:  Now , let’ s consider a familiar setting. For
example, let’ s say you’ve been picking up litter around your
workplace. The thing is, no one seems to notice at all. Or if
they do, no one has given you any appreciation for what
you’ve done, or even said a single word of thanks. W ell, will
you keep on picking up litter from now on?
YOUTH:  That’ s a dif ficult situation. I suppose that if no one
appreciates what I’m doing, I might stop.
PHILOSOPHER:  Why?
YOUTH:  Picking up litter is for everyone. If I’m rolling up my
sleeves and getting it done, but I don’ t get a word of thanks? I
guess I’d probably lose my motivation.
PHILOSOPHER:  This is the danger of the desire for recognition.
Why is it that people seek recognition from others? In many
cases, it is due to the influence of reward-and-punishment
education.
YOUTH:  Reward-and-punishment education?
PHILOSOPHER:  If one takes appropriate action, one receives
praise. If one takes inappropriate action, one receivespunishment. Adler was very critical of education by reward
and punishment. It leads to mistaken lifestyles in which people
think, If no one is going to praise me, I won’ t take appr opriate
action  and If no one is going to punish me, I’ll engage in
inappr opriate actions, too . Y ou already have the goal of
wanting to be praised when you start picking up litter . And if
you aren’ t praised by anyone, you’ll either be indignant, or
decide that you’ll never do such a thing again. Clearly , there’ s
something wrong with this situation.
YOUTH:  No! I wish you wouldn’ t trivialise things. I’m not
ar guing about education. W anting to be recognised by people
you like, to be accepted by people close to you, is a normal
desire.
PHILOSOPHER:  Y ou are badly mistaken. Look, we are not living
to satisfy other people’ s expectations.
YOUTH:  What do you mean?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y ou are not living to satisfy other people’ s
expectations, and neither am I. It is not necessary to satisfy
other people’ s expectations.
YOUTH:  That is such a self-serving ar gument! Are you saying
one should think only about oneself and live self-righteously?
PHILOSOPHER:  In the teachings of Judaism, one finds a view
that goes something like this: if you are not living your life for
yourself, then who is going to live it for you? Y ou are living
only your own life. When it comes to who you are living it for ,
of course it’ s you. And then, if you are not living your life for
yourself, who could there be to live it instead of you?
Ultimately , we live thinking about ‘I’. There is no reason that
we must not think that way .
YOUTH:  So, you are af flicted by the poison of nihilism, after
all. Y ou say that, ultimately , we live thinking about ‘I’? And
that that’ s okay? What a wretched way of thinking!
PHILOSOPHER:  It is not nihilism at all. Rather , it’ s the opposite.
When one seeks recognition from others, and concerns oneself
only with how one is judged by others, in the end, one is living
other people’ s lives.YOUTH:  What does that mean?
PHILOSOPHER:  W ishing so hard to be recognised will lead to a
life of following expectations held by other people who want
you to be ‘this kind of person’. In other words, you throw
away who you really are and live other people’ s lives. And
please remember this: if you are not living to satisfy other
people’ s expectations, it follows that other people are not
living to satisfy your expectations. Someone might not act the
way you want him to, but it doesn’ t do to get angry . That’ s
only natural.
YOUTH:  No, it is not! That is an ar gument that overturns our
society from its very foundation. Look, we have the desire for
recognition. But in order to receive recognition from others,
first we have to recognise others ourselves. It is because one
recognises other people and other systems of values that one is
recognised by others. It is through this relationship of mutual
recognition that our very society is built. Y our ar gument is an
abhorrent, dangerous way of thinking, which will drive human
beings into isolation and lead to conflict. It’ s a diabolical
solicitation to needlessly stir up distrust and doubt.
PHILOSOPHER:  Ha-ha, you certainly have an interesting
vocabulary . There’ s no need to raise your voice—let’ s think
about this together . One has to get recognition, or one will
suf fer . If one doesn’ t get recognition from others and from
one’ s parents, one won’ t have confidence. Can such a life be
healthy? So, one could think, God is watching, so accumulate
good deeds.  But that and the nihilist view that says ‘there is no
God, so all evil deeds are permitted’ are two sides of the same
coin. Even supposing that God did not exist, and that we could
not gain recognition from God, we would still have to live this
life. Indeed, it is in order to overcome the nihilism of a godless
world that it is necessary to deny recognition from other
people.
YOUTH:  I don’ t care for all this talk about God. Think more
straightforwardly and more plainly about the mentality of real,
everyday people. What about the desire to be recognised
socially , for example? Why does a person want to climb the
corporate ladder? Why does a person seek status and fame?It’ s the wish to be recognised as somebody important by
society as a whole—it’ s the desire for recognition.
PHILOSOPHER:  Then, if you get that recognition, would you say
that you’ve really found happiness? Do people who have
established their social status truly feel happy?
YOUTH:  No, but that’ s …
PHILOSOPHER:  When trying to be recognised by others, almost
all people treat satisfying other people’ s expectations as the
means to that end. And that is in accordance with the stream of
thought of reward-and-punishment education that says one
will be praised if one takes appropriate action. If, for example,
the main point of your job turns out to be satisfying other
people’ s expectations, then that job is going to be very hard on
you. Because you’ll always be worried about other people
looking at you and fear their judgement, and you are
repressing your ‘I-ness’. It might come as a surprise to you,
but almost none of my clients who come for counselling are
selfish people. Rather , they are suf fering trying to meet the
expectations of other people, the expectations of their parents
and teachers. So, in a good way , they can’ t behave in a self-
centred fashion.
YOUTH:  So, I should be selfish?
PHILOSOPHER:  Do not behave without regard for others. T o
understand this, it is necessary to know about the idea in
Adlerian psychology known as ‘separation of tasks’.
YOUTH:  Separation of tasks? That’ s a new term. Let’ s hear
about it.
The youth’ s irritation had r eached its peak. Deny the desire
for recognition? Don’ t satisfy other people’ s expectations?
Live in a more self-centred way?  What on earth was this
philosopher saying? Isn’t the desir e for r ecognition itself
people’ s gr eatest motivator for associating with each other
and going about the formation of society? The youth
wonder ed, What if this ‘separation of tasks’ idea doesn’ t win
me over? I won’ t be able to accept this man, or Adler for that
matter , for the rest of my life.H O W  T O  S E P A R A T E  T A S K S
PHILOSOPHER:  Say there’ s a child who has a hard time studying.
He doesn’ t pay attention in class, doesn’ t do his homework,
and even leaves his books at school. Now , what would you do
if you were his father?
YOUTH:  W ell, of course, I would try everything I could think of
to get him to apply himself. I’d hire tutors and make him go to
a study centre, even if I had to pull him by the ear to get him
there. I’d say that’ s a parent’ s duty . And that’ s actually how I
was raised myself. I wasn’ t allowed to eat dinner until the
day’ s homework was done.
PHILOSOPHER:  Then, let me ask another question. Did you learn
to enjoy studying as a result of being made to do it in such a
heavy-handed manner?
YOUTH:  Unfortunately , I did not. I just took care of my studies
for school and for exams in a routine way .
PHILOSOPHER:  I see. All right, I will talk about this from the
basic stance of Adlerian psychology . When one is confronted
with the task of studying, for instance, in Adlerian psychology
we consider it from the perspective of ‘whose task is this?’
YOUTH:  Whose task?
PHILOSOPHER:  Whether the child studies or not. Whether he
goes out and plays with his friends, or not. Essentially this is
the child’ s task, not the parent’ s task.
YOUTH:  Do you mean that it is something the child is supposed
to do?
PHILOSOPHER:  Simply put, yes. There would be no point if the
parents studied instead of the child, would there?
YOUTH:  W ell, no, there wouldn’ t.
PHILOSOPHER:  Studying is the child’ s task. A parent’ s handling
of that by commanding the child to study is, in ef fect, an act of
intruding on another person’ s task. One is unlikely to avert a
collision in this way . W e need to think with the perspective of‘whose task is this?’ and continually separate one’ s own tasks
from other people’ s tasks.
YOUTH:  How does one go about separating them?
PHILOSOPHER:  One does not intrude on other people’ s tasks.
That’ s all.
YOUTH:  That’ s all?
PHILOSOPHER:  In general, all interpersonal relationship troubles
are caused by intruding on other people’ s tasks, or having
one’ s own tasks intruded on. Carrying out the separation of
tasks is enough to change one’ s interpersonal relationships
dramatically .
YOUTH:  Hmm. I don’ t really get it. In the first place, how can
you tell whose task it is? From my point of view , realistically
speaking, getting one’ s child to study is the duty of the parents.
Because almost no child studies just out of enjoyment, and
after all is said and done, the parent is the child’ s guardian.
PHILOSOPHER:  There is a simple way to tell whose task it is.
Think, Who ultimately is going to r eceive the end r esult
br ought about by the choice that is made?  When the child has
made the choice of not studying, ultimately , the end result of
that decision—not being able to keep up in class or to get into
the preferred school, for instance—does not have to be
received by the parents. Clearly , it is the child who has to
receive it. In other words, studying is the child’ s task.
YOUTH:  No, no. Y ou’re completely wrong! The parent, who is
more experienced in life and also acts as a guardian, has the
responsibility to ur ge the child to study so such situations do
not arise. This is something done for the good of the child and
is not an act of intruding. While studying may be the child’ s
task, getting the child to study is the parent’ s task.
PHILOSOPHER:  It’ s true that one often hears parents today using
the phrase, ‘It’ s for your own good.’ But they are clearly doing
so in order to fulfil their own goals, which could be their
appearance in the eyes of society , their need to put on airs, or
their desire for control, for example. In other words, it is not‘for your own good’, but for the parents’. And it is because the
child senses this deception that he rebels.
YOUTH:  So, even if the child hasn’ t been studying at all, you’re
saying that, since it’ s his task, I should just let him be?
PHILOSOPHER:  One has to pay attention. Adlerian psychology
does not recommend the non-interference approach. Non-
interference is the attitude of not knowing, and not even being
interested in knowing what the child is doing. Instead, it is by
knowing what the child is doing that one protects him. If it’ s
studying that is the issue, one tells the child that that is his
task, and one lets him know that one is ready to assist him
whenever he has the ur ge to study . But one must not intrude on
the child’ s task. When no requests are being made, it does not
do to meddle in things.
YOUTH:  Does this go beyond parent–child relationships?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, of course. In Adlerian psychology
counselling, for instance, we do not think of the client’ s
changing or not changing as the task of the counsellor .
YOUTH:  What are you saying here?
PHILOSOPHER:  As a result of having received counselling, what
kind of resolution does the client make? T o change his
lifestyle, or not. This is the client’ s task, and the counsellor
cannot intervene.
YOUTH:  No way , I can’ t accept such an irresponsible attitude!
PHILOSOPHER:  Naturally , one gives all the assistance one
possibly can. But beyond that, one doesn’ t intrude. There’ s a
saying that goes, ‘Y ou can lead a horse to water , but you can’ t
make him drink.’ Please think of counselling and all other
assistance provided to other people in Adlerian psychology as
having that kind of stance. Forcing change while ignoring the
person’ s intentions will only lead to an intense reaction.
YOUTH:  The counsellor does not change the client’ s life?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y ou are the only one who can change yourself.D I S C A R D  O T H E R  P E O P L E ’ S
T A S K S
YOUTH:  Then, what about with shut-ins, for example? I mean,
with someone like my friend. Even then, would you say , it’ s
the separation of tasks, don’ t intervene, and it has no
connection to the parents?
PHILOSOPHER:  Can he break out of the shut-in situation or not?
Or , in what way can he break out of it? In principle, this is a
task that the person has to resolve himself. It is not for the
parents to intervene. Nevertheless, as they are not complete
strangers, some form of assistance is probably needed. At this
point, the most important thing is whether the child feels he
can consult frankly with his parents when he is experiencing a
dilemma, and whether they have been building enough of a
trust relationship on a regular basis.
YOUTH:  Then, supposing your own child had shut himself in,
what would you do? Please answer this not as a philosopher ,
but as a parent.
PHILOSOPHER:  First, I myself would think, This is the child’ s
task . I would try not to intervene in his shut-in situation, and I
would refrain from focusing too much attention on it. Then, I
would send a message to him to the ef fect that I am ready to
assist him whenever he is in need. In that way , the child,
having sensed a change in his parent, will have no choice but
to make it his own task to think about what he should do. He’ll
probably come and ask for assistance, and he’ll probably try to
work some things out on his own.
YOUTH:  Could you really manage to be so cut and dried if it
were your own child who’d become a shut-in?
PHILOSOPHER:  A parent suf fering over the relationship with his
or her child will tend to think, My child is my life . In other
words, the parent is taking on the child’ s task as his or her
own, and is no longer able to think about anything but the
child. When at last the parent notices it, the ‘I’ is already gone
from his or her life. However , no matter how much of theburden of the child’ s task one carries, the child is still an
independent individual. Children do not become what their
parents want them to become. In their choices of university ,
place of employment and partner in marriage, and even in the
everyday subtleties of speech and conduct, they do not act
according to their parents’ wishes. Naturally , the parents will
worry about them, and probably want to intervene at times.
But, as I said earlier , other people are not living to satisfy your
expectations. Though the child is one’ s own, he or she is not
living to satisfy one’ s expectations as a parent.
YOUTH:  So, you have to draw the line even with family?
PHILOSOPHER:  Actually , with families there is less distance, so
it’ s all the more necessary to consciously separate the tasks.
YOUTH:  That doesn’ t make sense. On the one hand, you’re
talking about love, and on the other , you’re denying it. If you
draw the line between yourself and other people that way , you
won’ t be able to believe in anyone anymore!
PHILOSOPHER:  Look, the act of believing is also the separation
of tasks. Y ou believe in your partner; that is your task. But
how that person acts with regard to your expectations and trust
is other people’ s tasks. When you push your wishes without
having drawn that line, before you know it you’re engaging in
stalker -like intervention. Supposing your partner did not act as
you had wished. W ould you still be able to believe in that
person? W ould you still be able to love that person? The task
of love that Adler speaks of is comprised of such questions.
YOUTH:  That’ s dif ficult! That’ s very dif ficult.
PHILOSOPHER:  Of course, it is. But think about it this way:
intervening in other people’ s tasks and taking on other
people’ s tasks turns one’ s life into something heavy and full of
hardship. If you are leading a life of worry and suf fering—
which stems from interpersonal relationships—first, learn the
boundary of ‘from here on, that is not my task’. And discard
other people’ s tasks. That is the first step toward lightening the
load and making life simpler .H O W  T O  R I D  Y O U R S E L F  O F
I N T E R P E R S O N A L
R E L A T I O N S H I P  P R O B L E M S
YOUTH:  I don’ t know , it just doesn’ t sit right with me.
PHILOSOPHER:  Then, let’ s envision a scene in which your
parents are vehemently opposing your choice of place of
employment. They were in fact against it, weren’ t they?
YOUTH:  Y es, they were. I wouldn’ t go so far as saying they
were vehemently opposed, but they did make various snide
remarks.
PHILOSOPHER:  W ell, let’ s exaggerate it and say they were
vehemently opposed. Y our father was ranting and raving with
emotion, and your mother was protesting your decision with
tears in her eyes. They absolutely do not approve of you
becoming a librarian, and if you will not take on the family
business like your brother has, they may very well disown
you. But how to come to terms with the emotion of ‘not
approving’ is your parents’ task, not yours. It is not a problem
for you to worry about.
YOUTH:  Now , wait a minute. Are you saying that it doesn’ t
matter how sad I make my parents feel?
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right. It doesn’ t matter .
YOUTH:  Y ou’ve got to be joking! Could there be such a thing as
a philosophy that recommends unfilial behaviour?
PHILOSOPHER:  All you can do with regard to your own life is
choose the best path that you believe in. On the other hand,
what kind of judgement do other people pass on that choice?
That is the task of other people, and is not a matter you can do
anything about.
YOUTH:  What another person thinks of you—if they like you or
dislike you—that is that person’ s task, not mine. Is that what
you are saying?PHILOSOPHER:  That is what separating is. Y ou are worried about
other people looking at you. Y ou are worried about being
judged by other people. That is why you are constantly craving
recognition from others. Now , why are you worried about
other people looking at you, anyway? Adlerian psychology has
an easy answer . Y ou haven’ t done the separation of tasks yet.
Y ou assume that even things that should be other people’ s
tasks are your own. Remember the words of the grandmother:
‘Y ou’re the only one who’ s worried how you look.’ Her
remark drives right to the heart of the separation of tasks.
What other people think when they see your face—that is the
task of other people, and is not something you have any
control over .
YOUTH:  As theory , I get it. T o my reasoning brain, it does make
sense. But my emotions can’ t keep up with such a high-handed
ar gument.
PHILOSOPHER:  Then, let’ s try another tack. Say there’ s a man
who’ s distressed about the interpersonal relationships at the
company where he works. He has a completely irrational boss
who yells at him at every opportunity . No matter how hard he
tries, his boss doesn’ t acknowledge his ef forts and never even
really listens to what he says.
YOUTH:  That sounds exactly like my boss.
PHILOSOPHER:  But is being acknowledged by your boss ‘work’
that you should think of as top priority? It isn’ t your job to be
liked by people at the place you work. Y our boss doesn’ t like
you. And his reasons for not liking you are clearly
unreasonable. But in that case, there’ s no need for you to get
cosy with him.
YOUTH:  That sounds right, but the person is my boss, right? I
won’ t get any work done if I’m shunned by my direct superior .
PHILOSOPHER:  That is Adler ’ s life-lie again. I can’ t do my work
because I’ve been shunned by my boss. It’ s the boss’ s fault
that my work isn’ t going well. The person who says such
things is bringing up the existence of the boss as an excuse for
the work that doesn’ t go well. Much like the female student
with the fear of blushing, it’ s actually that you need theexistence of an awful boss. Because then you can say , if only I
didn’ t have this boss, I could get more work done.
YOUTH:  No, you don’ t know my relationship with my boss! I
wish you would stop making arbitrary guesses.
PHILOSOPHER:  This is a discussion that is concerned with the
fundamentals of Adlerian psychology . If you are angry ,
nothing will sink in. Y ou think, I’ve got that boss, so I can’ t
work . This is complete aetiology . But it’ s really , I don’ t want to
work, so I’ll cr eate an awful boss , or I don’ t want to
acknowledge my incapable self, so I’ll cr eate an awful boss .
That would be the teleological way of looking at it.
YOUTH:  That’ s probably how it’d be framed in your stock
teleology approach. But, in my case, it’ s dif ferent.
PHILOSOPHER:  Then, supposing you had done the separation of
tasks. How would things be? In other words, no matter how
much your boss tries to vent his unreasonable anger at you,
that is not your task. The unreasonable emotions are tasks for
your boss to deal with himself. There is no need to cosy up to
him, or to yield to him to the point of bowing down. Y ou
should think, What I should do is face my own tasks in my own
life without lying.
YOUTH:  But, that’ s …
PHILOSOPHER:  W e are all suf fering in interpersonal
relationships. It might be the relationship with one’ s parents or
one’ s elder brother , and it might be the interpersonal
relationships at one’ s workplace. Now , last time, you were
saying that you wanted some specific steps. This is what I
propose. First, one should ask ‘whose task is this?’ Then do
the separation of tasks. Calmly delineate up to what point
one’ s own tasks go, and from what point they become another
person’ s tasks. And do not intervene in other people’ s tasks, or
allow even a single person to intervene in one’ s own tasks.
This is a specific and revolutionary viewpoint that is unique to
Adlerian psychology and contains the potential to utterly
change one’ s interpersonal relationship problems.
YOUTH:  Aha. I am starting to see what you meant when you
said that the topic of today’ s discussion was freedom.PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right. W e are trying to talk about freedom
now .C U T  T H E  G O R D I A N  K N O T
YOUTH:  I am sure that if one could understand the separation of
tasks and put it into practice, one’ s interpersonal relationships
would all at once become free. But I still can’ t accept it.
PHILOSOPHER:  Go on. I’m listening.
YOUTH:  I think that, in theory , the separation of tasks is entirely
right. What other people think of me, or what sort of
judgement they pass on me, is the task of other people, and is
not something I can do anything about. And I should just do
what I have to do in my life without lying. I’d have no
problem if you said this is a life truth—that’ s how right I think
it is. But, consider this: from an ethical or moral point of view ,
could it be said to be the right thing to do? That is to say , a
way of living that draws boundaries between oneself and
others. Because wouldn’ t you be brushing other people away
and saying ‘That’ s intervention!’ whenever they were worried
about you and asked how you’re doing? It seems to me that
this is something that treads on the goodwill of others.
PHILOSOPHER:  Have you heard of the man known as Alexander
the Great?
YOUTH:  Alexander the Great? Y es, I learned about him in
world history .
PHILOSOPHER:  He was a Macedonian king, who lived in the
fourth century before Christ. When he was advancing on the
Persian kingdom of L ydia, he learned of a chariot enshrined in
the acropolis. The chariot had been secured tightly to a pillar
in the temple by Gordias, the former king, and there was a
local legend that said, ‘He who unravels this knot shall be
master of Asia.’ It was a tightly wound knot that many men of
skill had been certain they could unbind, but no one had
succeeded. Now , what do you think Alexander the Great did
when he stood before this knot?
YOUTH:  W ell, didn’ t he unravel the legendary knot with ease,
and go on to become the ruler of Asia?PHILOSOPHER:  No, that’ s not how it happened. As soon as
Alexander the Great saw how tight the knot was, he pulled out
his sword and sliced it in half with one stroke.
YOUTH:  W ow!
PHILOSOPHER:  Then, it is said that he declared, ‘Destiny is not
something brought about by legend, but by clearing away with
one’ s own sword.’ He had no use for the power of legend, and
would for ge his destiny with his sword. As you know , he then
proceeded to become the great conqueror of all the territories
of what is now the Middle East and western Asia. This is the
famous anecdote known as the Gordian knot. And so, such
intricate knots—the bonds in our interpersonal relationships—
are not to be unravelled by conventional methods, but must be
severed by some completely new approach. Whenever I
explain the separation of tasks, I always remember the
Gordian knot.
YOUTH:  W ell, I don’ t mean to contradict you, but not everyone
can become Alexander the Great. Isn’ t it precisely because
there was no one else who could have cut the knot that the
anecdote portraying it as a heroic deed is still conveyed to this
day? It’ s exactly the same with the separation of tasks. Even
though one knows one can just cut through something with
one’ s sword, one might find it rather dif ficult. Because when
one presses forward with the separation of tasks, in the end
one will have to cut ties with people. One will drive people
into isolation. The separation of tasks you speak of completely
ignores human emotion! How could one possibly build good
interpersonal relationships with that?
PHILOSOPHER:  One can build them. The separation of tasks is
not the final objective for interpersonal relationships. Rather , it
is the gateway .
YOUTH:  The gateway?
PHILOSOPHER:  For instance, when reading a book, if one brings
one’ s face too close to it, one cannot see anything. In the same
way , forming good interpersonal relationships requires a
certain degree of distance. When the distance gets too small
and people become stuck together , it becomes impossible toeven speak to each other . But the distance must not be too
great, either . Parents who scold their children too much
become mentally very distant. When this happens, the child
can no longer even consult the parents, and the parents can no
longer give the proper assistance. One should be ready to lend
a hand when needed, but not encroach on the person’ s
territory . It is important to maintain this kind of moderate
distance.
YOUTH:  Is distance necessary even in the kind of relationship
that parents and children have?
PHILOSOPHER:  Of course. Earlier , you said that the separation of
tasks is something that treads on the other person’ s goodwill.
That is a notion that is tied to reward. It’ s the idea that when
another person does something for you, you have to do
something in return—even if that person does not want
anything. Rather than responding to the goodwill, it is just
being tied to reward. No matter what sort of appeal the other
person might make, you are the only one who decides what
you should do.
YOUTH:  Reward is at the root of what I am calling ‘ties’?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. When reward is at the base of an
interpersonal relationship, there’ s a feeling that wells up in one
that says, ‘I gave this much, so you should give me that much
back.’ This is a notion that is quite dif ferent from separation of
tasks, of course. W e must not seek reward, and we must not be
tied to it.
YOUTH:  Hmm.
PHILOSOPHER:  However , there are certainly situations in which
it would be easier to intervene in the tasks of another person
without doing any separation of tasks. For instance, in a child-
raising situation, when a child is having a hard time tying his
shoes. For the busy mother , it is certainly faster to tie them
than to wait for him to do it himself. But that is an
intervention, and it is taking the child’ s task away from him.
And as a result of repeating that intervention, the child will
cease to learn anything, and will lose the courage to face hislife tasks. As Adler says, ‘Children who have not been taught
to confront challenges will try to avoid all challenges.’
YOUTH:  But that is such a dry way of thinking.
PHILOSOPHER:  When Alexander the Great cut the Gordian knot,
there were probably those who felt the same way; that the
unravelling of the knot by hand had meaning, and that it was a
mistake to cut it with a sword; that Alexander had
misunderstood the meaning of the oracle’ s words. In Adlerian
psychology , there are aspects that are antithetical to normal
social thinking. It denies aetiology , denies trauma and adopts
teleology . It treats people’ s problems as interpersonal
relationship problems. And the not-seeking of recognition and
the separation of tasks, too, are probably antithetical to normal
social thinking.
YOUTH:  It’ s impossible! I can’ t do it!
PHILOSOPHER:  Why?
The youth was devastated by the separation of tasks that
the philosopher had begun describing. When one thought
of all one’ s pr oblems as being in one’ s interpersonal
r elationships, the separation of tasks was effective. Just by
having this viewpoint, the world would become quite
simple. But ther e was no flesh and blood in it. It gave off
no sense of one’ s warmth as a person. Could anyone accept
such a philosophy? The youth r ose fr om his chair and
pleaded loudly .D E S I R E  F O R  R E C O G N I T I O N
M A K E S  Y O U  U N F R E E
YOUTH:  Look, I have been dissatisfied for ages. The adults of
the world tell the young people, ‘Do something you like to
do.’ And they do it with smiles on their faces as if they might
actually be understanding people; as if they were on the side of
the young. But it’ s all lip service that only comes out because
those young people are complete strangers to them, and the
relationship is one that is completely without any kind of
responsibility . Then, parents and teachers tell us, ‘Get into that
school,’ or ‘Look for a stable occupation,’ and this concrete
and uninteresting instruction is not merely an intervention. It’ s
actually that they are trying to fulfil their responsibilities. It’ s
precisely because we are closely connected to them and they
are seriously concerned about our future, that they can’ t say
irresponsible things like ‘Do something you like.’ I’m sure
you’d put on that understanding face too, and say to me,
‘Please do something you like.’ But, I won’ t believe such a
comment from another person! It’ s an extremely irresponsible
comment, as if one were just brushing a caterpillar of f one’ s
shoulder . And if the world crushed that caterpillar , you would
say , ‘It’ s not my task,’ and walk away nonchalantly . What
separation of tasks, you monster!
PHILOSOPHER:  Oh goodness, you’re getting all bent out of
shape. So, what you are saying, in other words, is that you
want someone to intervene to some extent? That you want
another person to decide your path?
YOUTH:  Sure, maybe I do! It’ s like this: it’ s not so dif ficult to
judge what others expect of one, or what kind of role is being
demanded of one. Living as one likes, on the other hand, is
extremely dif ficult. What does one want? What does one want
to become, and what kind of life does one want to lead? One
doesn’ t always get such a concrete idea of things. It would be
a grave mistake to think that everyone has clear -cut dreams
and objectives. Don’ t you know that?PHILOSOPHER:  Maybe it is easier to live in such a way as to
satisfy other people’ s expectations. Because one is entrusting
one’ s own life to them. For example, one runs along the tracks
that one’ s parents have laid out. Even if there are a lot of
things one might object to, one will not lose one’ s way as long
as one stays on those rails. But if one is deciding one’ s path
oneself, it’ s only natural that one will get lost at times. One
comes up against the wall of ‘how one should live’.
YOUTH:  That is what I am looking for recognition from others
for . Y ou were talking about God earlier , and if we were still
living in an era when God was something people believed in, I
suppose that ‘God is watching’ might serve as a criterion for
self-discipline. If one were recognised by God, maybe one
didn’ t need recognition from others. But that era ended a long
time ago. And, in that case, one has no choice but to discipline
oneself on the basis that other people are watching. T o aspire
to be recognised by others and live an honest life. Other
people’ s eyes are my guide.
PHILOSOPHER:  Does one choose recognition from others, or
does one choose a path of freedom without recognition? It’ s an
important question—let’ s think about it together . T o live one’ s
life trying to gauge other people’ s feelings and being worried
about how they look at you. T o live in such a way that other ’ s
wishes are granted. There may indeed be signposts to guide
you this way , but it is a very unfree way to live. Now , why are
you choosing such an unfree way to live? Y ou are using the
term ‘desire for recognition’, but what you are really saying is
that you don’ t want to be disliked by anyone.
YOUTH:  Who does? There’ s no one anywhere who’d go so far
as to actually want to be disliked.
PHILOSOPHER:  Exactly . It is true that there is no person who
wishes to be disliked. But look at it this way: what should one
do to not be disliked by anyone? There is only one answer: it
is to constantly gauge other people’ s feelings, while swearing
loyalty to all of them. If there are ten people, one must swear
loyalty to all ten. When one does that, for the time being one
will have succeeded in not being disliked by anyone. But at
this point, there is a great contradiction looming. One swearsloyalty to all ten people out of the single-minded desire to not
be disliked. This is like a politician who has fallen into
populism and begun to make impossible promises and accept
responsibilities that are beyond him. Naturally , his lies will
come to light before long. He will lose people’ s trust, and turn
his own life into one of greater suf fering. And, of course, the
stress of continual lying has all kinds of consequences. Please
grasp this point. If one is living in a such a way as to satisfy
other people’ s expectations, and one is entrusting one’ s own
life to others, that is a way of living in which one is lying to
oneself, and continuing that lying to include the people around
one.
YOUTH:  So, one should be egocentric, and live however one
pleases?
PHILOSOPHER:  Separating one’ s tasks is not an egocentric thing.
Intervening in other people’ s tasks is essentially an egocentric
way of thinking, however . Parents force their children to
study; they meddle in their life and marriage choices. That is
nothing other than an egocentric way of thinking.
YOUTH:  So, the child can just ignore his parent’ s intentions and
live however he pleases?
PHILOSOPHER:  There is no reason of any sort that one should
not live one’ s life as one pleases.
YOUTH:  Ha-ha! Not only are you a nihilist, you’re an anarchist
and a hedonist to boot. I’m past being astonished, and now I’m
going to start laughing any moment.
PHILOSOPHER:  An adult, who has chosen an unfree way to live,
on seeing a young person living freely here and now in this
moment, criticises the youth as being hedonistic; of course,
this is a life-lie that comes out so that the adult can accept his
own unfree life. An adult who has chosen real freedom himself
will not make such comments, and will instead cheer on the
will to be free.
YOUTH:  All right, so what you are maintaining is that freedom
is the issue? Let’ s get to the main point. Y ou’ve been using the
word ‘freedom’ a lot, but what does freedom mean to you,
anyway? How can we be free?W H A T  R E A L  F R E E D O M  I S
PHILOSOPHER:  Earlier , you acknowledged that you do not want
to be disliked by anyone, and said, ‘There’ s no one anywhere
who’d go so far as to actually want to be disliked.’
YOUTH:  Right.
PHILOSOPHER:  W ell, I’m the same way . I have no desire to be
disliked by other people. I would say that ‘no one would go so
far as to actually want to be disliked’ is a sharp insight.
YOUTH:  It’ s a universal desire!
PHILOSOPHER:  Even so, regardless of our ef forts, there are
people who dislike me, and people who dislike you. This, too,
is a fact. When you are disliked, or feel that you are being
disliked, by someone, what state of mind does it put you in?
YOUTH:  V ery distressed, to put it simply . I wonder why I’ve
come to be disliked, and what I did or said that might have
been of fensive. I think I should have interacted with the person
in a dif ferent way , and I just brood and brood over it and am
ridden with guilt.
PHILOSOPHER:  Not wanting to be disliked by other people. T o
human beings, this is an entirely natural desire, and an
impulse. Kant, the giant of modern philosophy , called this
desire ‘inclination’.
YOUTH:  Inclination?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, it is one’ s instinctive desires, one’ s
impulsive desires. Now , if one were to say that living like a
stone tumbling downhill and allowing such inclinations or
desires or impulses to take one wherever they will is
‘freedom’, one would be incorrect. T o live in such a way is
only to be a slave to one’ s desires and impulses. Real freedom
is an attitude akin to pushing up one’ s tumbling self from
below .
YOUTH:  Pushing oneself up from below?PHILOSOPHER:  A stone is powerless. Once it has begun to roll
downhill, it will continue to roll until released from the natural
laws of gravity and inertia. But we are not stones. W e are
beings who are capable of resisting inclination. W e can stop
our tumbling selves and climb uphill. The desire for
recognition is probably a natural desire. So, are you going to
keep rolling downhill in order to receive recognition from
others? Are you going to wear yourself down like a rolling
stone, until everything is smoothed away? When all that is left
is a little round ball, would that be ‘the real I’? It cannot be.
YOUTH:  Are you saying that resisting one’ s instincts and
impulses is freedom?
PHILOSOPHER:  As I have stated repeatedly , in Adlerian
psychology , we think that all problems are interpersonal
relationship problems. In other words, we seek release from
interpersonal relationships. W e seek to be free from
interpersonal relationships. However , it is absolutely
impossible to live all alone in the universe. In light of what we
have discussed until now , the conclusion we reach regarding
‘what is freedom?’ should be clear .
YOUTH:  What is it?
PHILOSOPHER:  In short, that ‘freedom is being disliked by other
people’.
YOUTH:  Huh? What was that?
PHILOSOPHER:  It’ s that you are disliked by someone. It is proof
that you are exercising your freedom and living in freedom,
and a sign that you are living in accordance with your own
principles.
YOUTH:  But, but …
PHILOSOPHER:  It is certainly distressful to be disliked. If
possible, one would like to live without being disliked by
anyone. One wants to satisfy one’ s desire for recognition. But
conducting oneself in such a way as to not be disliked by
anyone is an extremely unfree way of living, and is also
impossible. There is a cost incurred when one wants to
exercise one’ s freedom. And the cost of freedom ininterpersonal relationships is that one is disliked by other
people.
YOUTH:  No! That’ s totally wrong. There is no way that could
be called freedom. That’ s a diabolical way of thinking to coax
one into evildoing.
PHILOSOPHER:  Y ou’ve probably been thinking of freedom as
‘release from or ganisations’. That breaking away from your
home or school, your company or your nation is freedom.
However , if you were to break away from your or ganisation,
for instance, you would not be able to gain real freedom.
Unless one is unconcerned by other people’ s judgements, has
no fear of being disliked by other people, and pays the cost
that one might never be recognised, one will never be able to
follow through in one’ s own way of living. That is to say , one
will not be able to be free.
YOUTH:  Be disliked by other people—is that what you are
saying?
PHILOSOPHER:  What I am saying is, don’ t be afraid of being
disliked.
YOUTH:  But that’ s—
PHILOSOPHER:  I am not telling you to go so far as to live in such
a way that you will be disliked, and I am not saying engage in
wrongdoing. Please do not misunderstand that.
YOUTH:  No. Then, let’ s change the question. Can people
actually endure the weight of freedom? Are people that
strong? T o not care even if one is disliked by one’ s own
parents—can one become so self-righteously defiant?
PHILOSOPHER:  One neither prepares to be self-righteous, nor
becomes defiant. One just separates tasks. There may be a
person who does not think well of you, but that is not your
task. And again, thinking things like, He should like me , or
I’ve done all this, so it’ s strange that he doesn’ t like me , is the
reward-oriented way of thinking of having intervened in
another person’ s tasks. One moves forward without fearing the
possibility of being disliked. One does not live as if one were
rolling downhill, but instead climbs the slope that lies ahead.That is freedom for a human being. Suppose that I had two
choices in front of me—a life in which all people like me, and
a life in which there are people who dislike me—and I was
told to choose one. I would choose the latter without a second
thought. Before being concerned with what others think of me,
I want to follow through with my own being. That is to say , I
want to live in freedom.
YOUTH:  Are you free, now?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. I am free.
YOUTH:  Y ou do not want to be disliked, but you don’ t mind if
you are?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, that’ s right. ‘Not wanting to be disliked’ is
probably my task, but whether or not so-and-so dislikes me is
the other person’ s task. Even if there is a person who doesn’ t
think well of me, I cannot intervene in that. T o borrow from
the proverb I mentioned earlier , naturally one would make the
ef fort to lead a horse to water . But whether he drinks or not is
that person’ s task.
YOUTH:  That’ s some conclusion.
PHILOSOPHER:  The courage to be happy also includes the
courage to be disliked. When you have gained that courage,
your interpersonal relationships will all at once change into
things of lightness.Y O U  H O L D  T H E  C A R D S  T O
I N T E R P E R S O N A L
R E L A T I O N S H I P S
YOUTH:  W ell, I never would have imagined I’d visit a
philosopher ’ s place to hear about being disliked.
PHILOSOPHER:  I am well aware that this is not an easy thing to
swallow . It will probably take some time to chew over and
digest. If we go any farther with this today , I think you won’ t
be able to keep it in your head. So, I would like to talk to you
about one more thing, a personal matter that relates to the
separation of tasks, and then finish up for today .
YOUTH:  All right.
PHILOSOPHER:  This one, too, is about relationships with parents.
My relationship with my father had always been a rocky one,
even when I was a child. My mother died when I was in my
twenties, without us ever engaging in anything like real
conversation together , and after that my relationship with my
father became increasingly strained. That is, until I
encountered Adlerian psychology and grasped Adler ’ s ideas.
YOUTH:  Why did you have a bad relationship with your father?
PHILOSOPHER:  What I have in my memory is an image from a
time when he hit me. I have no recollection of what I might
have done to bring it on. I only remember hiding under a desk
in an attempt to escape him, when he dragged me out and hit
me hard. And not just once, but many times.
YOUTH:  That fear became a trauma …
PHILOSOPHER:  I think that until I encountered Adlerian
psychology , I understood it in that kind of way . Because my
father was a moody , taciturn person. But to think to myself, He
hit me that time, and that is why our r elationship went bad , is
a Freudian aetiological way of thinking. The Adlerian
teleology position completely reverses the cause-and-ef fect
interpretation. That is to say , I brought out the memory ofbeing hit because I don’ t want my relationship with my father
to get better .
YOUTH:  So, first you had the goal of not wanting your
relationship with your father to get better , and not wanting to
repair things between you.
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right. For me, it was more convenient to
not repair my relationship with my father . I could use having a
father like that as an excuse for why my own life wasn’ t going
well. That for me was a virtue. And there was also the aspect
of taking revenge on a feudal father .
YOUTH:  That is exactly what I wanted to ask about! Even if the
cause and ef fect were reversed, that is to say , in your case, you
were able to analyse yourself and say , ‘It isn’ t because he hit
me that I have a bad relationship with my father , but that I
brought out the memory of being hit because I don’ t want my
relationship with my father to get better ,’ even then, how does
it actually change things? It doesn’ t change the fact that you
were hit in childhood, right?
PHILOSOPHER:  One can think from the viewpoint that it is an
interpersonal relationship card. As long as I use aetiology to
think, It is because he hit me that I have a bad r elationship
with my father ,  it would be a matter that was impossible for me
to do anything about. But if I can think, I br ought out the
memory of being hit because I don’ t want my r elationship with
my father to get better , then I will be holding the card to repair
relations. Because if I can just change the goal that fixes
everything.
YOUTH:  Does that really fix things?
PHILOSOPHER:  Of course.
YOUTH:  I wonder if you really feel so from the bottom of your
heart. I can understand it in theory , but the feeling just doesn’ t
sit right with me.
PHILOSOPHER:  Then, it’ s the separation of tasks. It’ s true that
my father and I had a complicated relationship. He was a
stubborn person, and I could never imagine his feelings being
able to change easily . Moreover , there was a strong possibilitythat he had even for gotten ever raising his hands against me.
However , at the time of making my resolution to repair
relations, it did not matter to me what sort of lifestyle my
father had, or what he thought of me, or the kind of attitude he
might adopt in response to my approach—such things didn’ t
matter at all. Even if there were no intention to repair relations
on his side, I would not mind in the least. The issue was
whether or not I would resolve to do it, and I was always
holding the interpersonal relationship cards.
YOUTH:  Y ou were always holding the interpersonal relationship
cards?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. Many people think that the interpersonal
relationship cards are held by the other person. That is why
they wonder , How does that person feel about me? , and end up
living in such a way as to satisfy the wishes of other people.
But if they can grasp the separation of tasks, they will notice
that they are holding all the cards. This is a new way of
thinking.
YOUTH:  So, due to your changing, did your father change too?
PHILOSOPHER:  I did not change in order to change my father .
That is an erroneous notion of trying to manipulate another
person. Even if I change, it is only ‘I’ who changes. I do not
know what will happen to the other person as a result, and that
is not an aspect I can take part in. This too is the separation of
tasks. Of course, there are times when, in tandem with my
change—not due to  my change—the other person changes too.
In many cases, that person will have no choice but to change.
But that is not the goal, and it is certainly possible that the
other person will not change. In any case, changing one’ s own
speech and conduct as a way of manipulating other people is
clearly a mistaken way of thinking.
YOUTH:  One must not manipulate other people, and
manipulating cannot be done.
PHILOSOPHER:  When we speak of interpersonal relationships, it
always seems to be two-person relationships and one’ s
relationship to a lar ge group that come to mind, but first it is
oneself. When one is tied to the desire for recognition, theinterpersonal relationship cards will always stay in the hands
of other people. Does one entrust the cards of life to another
person, or hold onto them oneself? Please take your time and
sort through these ideas again in your own home, about the
separation of tasks and about freedom. I will be waiting for
you here, next time.
YOUTH:  All right. I will give it some thought on my own.
PHILOSOPHER:  W ell, then …
YOUTH:  Please, there is just one more thing I want to ask you.
PHILOSOPHER:  What is it?
YOUTH:  In the end, were you able to repair your relationship
with your father?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, of course. I think so. My father fell ill, and
in the last few years of his life, it was necessary for me and my
family to take care of him. Then one day , when I was taking
care of him as usual, my father said, ‘Thank you.’ I had not
known my father possessed such a word in his vocabulary , and
I was astonished and felt grateful for all the days that had
passed. Through the long years of my caregiving life, I had
tried to do whatever I could, that is to say , I had done my best
to lead my father to water . And in the end, he drank. I think he
did.
YOUTH:  W ell, thank you very much. I will come again at the
same time.
PHILOSOPHER:  I had a good time. Thank you, too.That was close—I almost fell for it!  The following week, the
young man called on the philosopher again, and, with an
indignant expr ession, knocked on the door .
The idea of separating tasks is certainly a useful one. Y ou
had me completely convinced last time. But it seems like such
a lonely way to live. Separating the tasks and lightening the
load of one’ s interpersonal relations is just the same as
cutting one’ s connection to other people. And, to top it of f,
you’re telling me to be disliked by other people? If that’ s
what you call freedom, then I’ll choose not to be free!I N D I V I D U A L  P S Y C H O L O G Y
A N D  H O L I S M
PHILOSOPHER:  W ell, you’re looking rather gloomy today .
YOUTH:  Y ou see, since we last met, I’ve been thinking calmly
and carefully about the separation of tasks, and about freedom.
I waited until my emotions had settled, and then applied my
reasoning mind. But the separation of tasks just doesn’ t seem
realistic.
PHILOSOPHER:  Hmm, okay . Please go on.
YOUTH:  Separating tasks is basically an idea that boils down to
defining a boundary and saying, ‘I am I, and you are you.’
Sure, there are probably fewer interpersonal relationship
problems that way . But would you really say that such a way
of life is right? T o me, it just seems like an extremely self-
centred, misguided individualism. On my first visit here, you
told me that Adlerian psychology is formally referred to as
‘individual psychology’. That term had been bothering me for
quite a while, but I finally figured out why: what you’re
calling Adlerian psychology , or individual psychology , is
essentially the study of an individualism that leads people into
isolation.
PHILOSOPHER:  It is true that the term ‘individual psychology’,
which Adler coined, has certain aspects that may invite
misunderstanding. I will explain what I mean now . First of all,
etymologically speaking, the word ‘individual’ has the
meaning ‘indivisible’.
YOUTH:  Indivisible?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. In other words, it is the smallest possible
unit, and therefore cannot be broken down any further . Now ,
what is it exactly that cannot be divided? Adler was opposed
to any kind of dualistic value system that treated the mind as
separate from the body; reason as separate from emotion, or
the conscious mind as separate from the unconscious mind.
YOUTH:  What’ s the point of that?PHILOSOPHER:  For example, do you remember the story about
the female student who came to me for counselling on account
of her fear of blushing? Why did she develop that fear of
blushing? In Adlerian psychology , physical symptoms are not
regarded separately from the mind (psyche). The mind and
body are viewed as one, as a whole that cannot be divided into
parts. T ension in the mind can make one’ s arms and legs
shake, or cause one’ s cheeks to turn red, and fear can make
one’ s face turn white. And so on.
YOUTH:  W ell, sure, there are parts of the mind and body that
are connected.
PHILOSOPHER:  The same holds true for reason and emotion, and
the conscious mind and the unconscious mind, as well. A
normally cool-headed person doesn’ t expect to have a fit of
violent emotion and start shouting at someone. W e are not
struck by emotions that somehow exist independently from us.
Each of us is a unified whole.
YOUTH:  No, that is not true. It is precisely because we have the
ability to view mind and body , reason and emotion, and the
conscious and the unconscious mind as clearly separate from
each other , that we can gain a correct understanding of people.
Isn’ t that a given?
PHILOSOPHER:  Certainly , it is true that the mind and the body
are separate things, that reason and emotion are dif ferent, and
that both the conscious mind and the unconscious mind exist.
That said, however , when one flies into a rage and shouts at
another person, it is ‘I as a whole’ who is choosing to shout.
One would never think of emotions that somehow exist
independently—unrelated to one’ s intentions, as it were—as
having produced that shouting voice. When one separates the
‘I’ from ‘emotion’ and thinks, It was the emotion that made
me do it , or The emotion got the best of me, and I couldn’ t help
it , such thinking quickly becomes a life-lie.
YOUTH:  Y ou’re referring to the time I yelled at that waiter ,
aren’ t you?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. This view of the human being as ‘I as a
whole’, as an indivisible being that cannot be broken downinto parts, is referred to as ‘holism’.
YOUTH:  W ell, that’ s fine. But I wasn’ t asking you for an
academic theory to provide a definition of ‘individual’. Look,
if you take Adlerian psychology to its logical conclusion, it’ s
basically saying ‘I am I, and you are you’ and leading people
toward isolation. It’ s saying, ‘I won’ t interfere with you, so
don’ t interfere with me either , and we’ll both go on living
however we please.’ Please tell me straightforwardly what
your awareness is of that point.
PHILOSOPHER:  All right. All problems are interpersonal
relationship problems. Y ou have an understanding of this basic
tenet of Adlerian psychology , correct?
YOUTH:  Y es, I do. The idea of non-interference in interpersonal
relations, that is to say , the separation of tasks, probably came
about as a way to resolve those problems.
PHILOSOPHER:  This is something I believe I went over last time
—that forming good interpersonal relationships requires a
certain degree of distance; while people who get too close end
up not even being able to speak to each other , it is not good to
get too far apart, either . Please do not think of the separation of
tasks as something that is meant to keep other people away;
instead, see it as a way of thinking with which to unravel the
threads of the complex entanglement of one’ s interpersonal
relations.
YOUTH:  T o unravel the threads?
PHILOSOPHER:  Exactly . Right now , your threads and other
people’ s threads are all tangled up in a confused mess, and you
are looking at the world while in that condition. Red, blue,
brown and green; all the colours mixing together—you think
of it as ‘connection’. But it is not.
YOUTH:  So, then, what do you think connection is?
PHILOSOPHER:  Last time, I spoke of the separation of tasks as a
prescription for resolving interpersonal relationship problems.
But interpersonal relationships are not something that end just
because one has separated the tasks. The separating of tasks is
actually the point of departure for interpersonal relations.T oday , let’ s take the discussion deeper , so as to address how
interpersonal relations as a whole are viewed in Adlerian
psychology , and consider the kind of relationships we should
form with others.T H E  G O A L  O F  I N T E R P E R S O N A L
R E L A T I O N S H I P S  I S  A  F E E L I N G
O F  C O M M U N I T Y
YOUTH:  Okay , I have a question. Please give me a simple
answer that gets straight to the heart of the matter . Y ou said
that the separating of tasks is the point of departure for
interpersonal relations. W ell, what is the goal of interpersonal
relations?
PHILOSOPHER:  T o get straight to the heart of the matter , it is
‘community feeling’.
YOUTH:  … Community feeling?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. This is a key concept in Adlerian
psychology , and views on its application have been the subject
of much debate. In fact, Adler ’ s proposal of the concept of
community feeling drove many people to part ways with him.
YOUTH:  W ell, it sounds fascinating to me. What is this concept?
PHILOSOPHER:  It was the time before last, I believe, that I
brought up the matter of how one sees others; that is, as
enemies or as comrades. Now , take that a step deeper . If other
people are our comrades, and we live surrounded by them, we
should be able to find in that life our own place of ‘refuge’.
Moreover , in doing so, we should begin to have the desire to
share with our comrades—to contribute to the community .
This sense of others as comrades, this awareness of ‘having
one’ s own refuge’, is called ‘community feeling’.
YOUTH:  But what part of this is open to debate? It seems like a
completely irrefutable point.
PHILOSOPHER:  The issue is community . What does it consist of?
When you hear the word ‘community’, what images come to
mind?
YOUTH:  There are such frameworks as one’ s household, school
or workplace, or local society .PHILOSOPHER:  When Adler refers to community , he goes
beyond the household, school, workplace and local society ,
and treats it as all-inclusive, covering not only nations and all
of humanity , but the entire axis of time from the past to the
future—and he includes plants and animals, and even
inanimate objects.
YOUTH:  Huh?
PHILOSOPHER:  In other words, he is espousing that community
is not merely one of the pre-existing frameworks that the word
might bring to mind, but is also inclusive of literally
everything ; the entire universe, from the past to the future.
YOUTH:  No way . Now you’ve lost me. The universe? Past and
future? What on earth are you talking about?
PHILOSOPHER:  The majority of those who hear this have similar
doubts. This is not something one can comprehend
immediately . Adler himself acknowledged that the community
he was espousing was ‘an unattainable ideal’.
YOUTH:  Ha-ha. W ell that’ s perplexing, isn’ t it? How about the
other way around, then? Do you really comprehend and accept
this community feeling, or whatever it is, that includes the
entire universe?
PHILOSOPHER:  I try to. Because I feel that one cannot truly
comprehend Adlerian psychology without comprehending this
point.
YOUTH:  Okay then!
PHILOSOPHER:  As I have been saying all along, Adlerian
psychology has the view that all problems are interpersonal
relationship problems. Interpersonal relations are the source of
unhappiness. And the opposite can be said, too—interpersonal
relations are the source of happiness.
YOUTH:  Indeed.
PHILOSOPHER:  Furthermore, community feeling is the most
important index for considering a state of interpersonal
relations that is happy .
YOUTH:  All right. I’d like to hear all about it.PHILOSOPHER:  Community feeling is also referred to as ‘social
interest’, that is to say , ‘interest in society’. So, now I have a
question for you: do you know what society’ s smallest unit is,
from the point of view of sociology?
YOUTH:  Society’ s smallest unit, huh? I’d say the family .
PHILOSOPHER:  No, it is ‘you and I’. When there are two people,
society emer ges in their presence, and community emer ges
there too. T o gain an understanding of the community feeling
that Adler speaks of, it is advisable to use ‘you and I’ as the
starting point.
YOUTH:  And what do you do with that as the starting point?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y ou make the switch from attachment to self
(self-interest) to concern for others (social interest).
YOUTH:  Attachment to self? Concern for others? What’ s all that
about?W H Y  A M  I  O N L Y  I N T E R E S T E D
I N  M Y S E L F ?
PHILOSOPHER:  W ell, let’ s consider this concretely . For purposes
of clarity , in place of ‘attachment to self ’, I will use the word
‘self-centred’. In your view , someone who is self-centred is
what sort of person?
YOUTH:  Hmm, I guess the first thing that comes to mind is the
kind of person who’ s like a tyrant. Someone who’ s
domineering, has no qualms about being a nuisance to others,
and only thinks about things that are to his own advantage. He
thinks that the world revolves around him, and he behaves like
a dictator who rules by absolute authority and force. He’ s the
kind of person who creates an enormous amount of trouble for
everyone around him. Someone who’ s just like Shakespeare’ s
King Lear , a typical tyrant.
PHILOSOPHER:  I see.
YOUTH:  On the other hand, he wouldn’ t necessarily be a tyrant
—one might speak of the sort of person who disturbs the
harmony of a group as self-centred, too. He’ s someone who
can’ t operate in a group, and prefers to act alone. He never
stops to reflect on his actions, even when he’ s late for
appointments or fails to keep his promises. In a word, he is an
egotist.
PHILOSOPHER:  T o be sure, that is the kind of image that
generally comes to mind when thinking of self-centred people.
But there is another type that must be taken into account.
People who are incapable of carrying out the separation of
tasks, and who are obsessed with the desire for recognition are
also extremely self-centred.
YOUTH:  Why is that?
PHILOSOPHER:  Consider the reality of the desire for recognition.
How much do others pay attention to you, and what is their
judgement of you? That is to say , how much do they satisfy
your desire? People who are obsessed with such a desire forrecognition will seem to be looking at other people, while they
are actually only looking at themselves. They lack concern for
others, and are concerned solely with the ‘I’. Simply put, they
are self-centred.
YOUTH:  So, would you say that people like me, who fear being
judged by others, are self-centred, too? Even though I try so
hard to be mindful of others and adjust myself to them?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. In the sense that you are concerned solely
with the ‘I’, you are self-centred. Y ou want to be thought well
of by others, and that is why you worry about the way they
look at you. That is not concern for others. It is nothing but
attachment to self.
YOUTH:  But …
PHILOSOPHER:  This is something I spoke of last time. The fact
that there are people who do not think well of you is proof that
you are living in freedom. Y ou might have a sense of
something about this that seems self-centred. But I think you
have understood this from today’ s discussion: a way of living
in which one is constantly troubled by how one is seen by
others is a self-centred lifestyle in which one’ s sole concern is
with the ‘I’.
YOUTH:  W ell now , that is an astounding statement!
PHILOSOPHER:  Not just you, but all people who are attached to
the ‘I’ are self-centred. And that is precisely why it is
necessary to make the switch from ‘attachment to self ’ to
‘concern for others’.
YOUTH:  Okay , so yes, it is true that I am always looking only at
myself; that, I acknowledge. I’m constantly worried about how
other people see me, but not about how I see them. If you are
saying I am self-centred, there is nothing that I can say to
refute that. But, think about it like this: if my life were a
feature-length movie, the protagonist would certainly be this
‘I’, wouldn’ t it? Is pointing the camera at the protagonist really
such a reprehensible thing?Y O U  A R E  N O T  T H E  C E N T R E  O F
T H E  W O R L D
PHILOSOPHER:  Let’ s go over things in order . First of all, each of
us is a member of a community , and that is where we belong.
Feeling that one has one’ s own place of refuge within the
community; feeling that ‘it’ s okay to be here’, and having a
sense of belonging—these are basic human desires. Whether it
is one’ s studies, work or friendships, or one’ s love or marriage,
all these things are connected to one’ s search for places and
relationships in which one can feel ‘it’ s okay to be here’.
W ouldn’ t you agree?
YOUTH:  Ah, yes, I do! That’ s it exactly!
PHILOSOPHER:  And the protagonist in one’ s life is the ‘I’. There
is nothing wrong with the train of thought up to this point. But
the ‘I’ does not rule the centre of the world. While the ‘I’ is
life’ s protagonist, it is never more than a member of the
community and a part of the whole.
YOUTH:  A part of the whole?
PHILOSOPHER:  People who have concern only for themselves
think that they are at the centre of the world. T o such people,
others are merely ‘people who will do something for  me’.
They half-genuinely believe that everyone else exists to serve
them, and should give precedence to their feelings.
YOUTH:  Just like a prince or a princess.
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, exactly . They make a leap from being ‘life’ s
protagonist’ to becoming ‘the world’ s protagonist’. For this
reason, whenever they come into contact with another person,
all they can think is, What will this person give me?  However
—and this is something that does not hold true for princes and
princesses—this expectation is not going to be satisfied on
every occasion. Because other people are not living to satisfy
your expectations.
YOUTH:  Indeed.PHILOSOPHER:  Then, when those expectations are not satisfied,
they become deeply disillusioned and feel as if they have been
horribly insulted. And they become resentful, and think, That
person didn’ t do anything for me ; That person let me down ;
That person isn’ t my comrade anymor e. He’ s my enemy .  People
who hold the belief that they are the centre of the world
always end up losing their comrades before long.
YOUTH:  That’ s strange. Didn’ t you say that we are living in a
subjective world? As long as the world is a subjective space, I
am the only one who can be at its centre. I won’ t let anyone
else be there.
PHILOSOPHER:  I think that when you speak of ‘the world’, what
you have in mind is something like a map of the world.
YOUTH:  A map of the world? What are you talking about?
PHILOSOPHER:  For example, on the map of the world used in
France, the Americas are located on the left side, and Asia on
the right. Europe and France are depicted at the centre of the
map, of course. The map of the world used in China, on the
other hand, shows the Americas on the right side, and Europe
on the left. French people who see the Chinese map of the
world will most likely experience a dif ficult-to-describe sense
of incongruity , as if they have been driven unjustly to the
fringes, or cut out of the world arbitrarily .
YOUTH:  Y es, I see your point.
PHILOSOPHER:  But what happens when a globe is used to
represent the world? Because with a globe, you can look at the
world with France at the centre, or China, or Brazil for that
matter . Every place is central, and no place is, at the same
time. The globe may be dotted with an infinite number of
centres, in accordance with the viewer ’ s location and angle of
view . That is the nature of a globe.
YOUTH:  Hmm, that is true.
PHILOSOPHER:  Think of what I said earlier—that you are not the
centre of the world — as being the same thing. Y ou are a part
of a community , not its centre.YOUTH:  I am not the centre of the world. Our world is a globe,
not a map that has been cut out on a plane. W ell, I can
understand that in theory , anyway . But why do I have to be
aware of the fact that I’m not the centre of the world?
PHILOSOPHER:  Now we will go back to where we started. All of
us are searching for the sense of belonging that ‘it’ s okay to be
here’. In Adlerian psychology , however , a sense of belonging
is something that one can attain only by making an active
commitment to the community of one’ s own accord, and not
simply by being here.
YOUTH:  By making an active commitment? What does one do,
exactly?
PHILOSOPHER:  One faces one’ s life tasks. In other words, one
takes steps forward on one’ s own, without avoiding the tasks
of the interpersonal relations of work, friendship and love. If
you are ‘the centre of the world’, you will have no thoughts
whatsoever regarding commitment to the community; because
everyone else is ‘someone who will do something for me’, and
there is no need for you to do things yourself. But you are not
the centre of the world, and neither am I. One has to stand on
one’ s own two feet, and take one’ s own steps forward with the
tasks of interpersonal relations. One needs to think not What
will this person give me?  but, rather , What can I give to this
person?  That is commitment to the community .
YOUTH:  It is because one gives something that one can find
one’ s refuge?
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right. A sense of belonging is something
that one acquires through one’ s own ef forts—it is not
something one is endowed with at birth. Community feeling is
the much-debated key concept of Adlerian psychology .
It was certainly a concept that the young man found
difficult to accept at first. And naturally , it upset him to be
told he was self-centr ed. But what he found harder to
accept than anything else was the incr edible extent of that
community , which included the universe and inanimate
objects. What wer e Adler and this philosopher talkingabout, anyway? W ith a bewilder ed expr ession, the young
man slowly opened his mouth to speak.L I S T E N  T O  T H E  V O I C E  O F  A
L A R G E R  C O M M U N I T Y
YOUTH:  I must admit, you’re starting to lose me. Let me try to
straighten things out a bit. First, at the gateway of
interpersonal relations, we’ve got the separation of tasks, and
as the goal, there’ s community feeling. And you’re saying that
community feeling is having ‘a sense of others as comrades’,
and ‘an awareness of having one’ s own refuge’ within the
community . Up to this point, it is something I can understand
and accept. But the details still seem a bit far -fetched. For one
thing, what do you mean by expanding this thing you call
‘community’ to include the entire universe, and then even the
past and the future, and everything from living things to
inanimate objects?
PHILOSOPHER:  It certainly does make things more dif ficult to
understand if one takes Adler ’ s concept of community
verbatim and tries to actually imagine it including the universe
and inanimate objects. For the time being, suf fice it to say that
the scope of community is infinite.
YOUTH:  Infinite?
PHILOSOPHER:  T ake, for example, a man who, on reaching
retirement age and stopping work, quickly loses his vitality
and becomes depressed. Abruptly cut of f from the company
that was his community and bereft of title or profession, he
becomes an ‘ordinary nobody’. As he is unable to accept the
fact that he is now ‘normal’, he becomes old practically
overnight. But all that really happened to the man is that he
was cut of f from the small community that is his company .
Each person belongs to a separate community . And when it
comes down to it, all of us belong to the community of the
earth, and the community of the universe.
YOUTH:  That’ s pure sophistry! T o suddenly come out with ‘you
belong to the universe’, as if that could give someone a sense
of belonging.PHILOSOPHER:  It’ s true, there’ s no way one can just imagine the
entire universe all of a sudden. Even so, I would like you to
gain the awareness that you belong to a separate, lar ger
community that is beyond the one you see in your immediate
vicinity—for example, the country or local society in which
you live—and that you are contributing in some way within
that community .
YOUTH:  Then, what about in a situation like this? Say there’ s a
guy who’ s unmarried, has lost his job and his friends, and who
avoids the company of other people and just lives of f the
money his parents left him. So, he’ s basically running away
from all the tasks of work, and tasks of friendship and tasks of
love. W ould you say that even a guy like that belongs to some
sort of community?
PHILOSOPHER:  Of course. Say he goes out to buy a loaf of
bread. He pays for it with a coin. That coin does not simply go
back to the bakers of the bread. It goes to the producers of
flour and butter; to the people who deliver those ingredients;
to the purveyors of the gasoline used by the delivery vehicles;
to people in the oil-producing countries where that fuel comes
from, and so on. So, it’ s all connected. People are never truly
alone or separate from community , and cannot be.
YOUTH:  So, you’re saying I should fantasise more when I buy
bread?
PHILOSOPHER:  It is not fantasy . It is fact. The community Adler
speaks of goes beyond things we can see, like our households
and societies, to include those connections that we cannot see.
YOUTH:  Excuse me for saying so, but you’re escaping into
abstract theory . The issue we should be addressing here is the
sense of belonging, that ‘it’ s okay to be here’. And then, with
regard to the meaning of this sense of belonging, it is the
community we can see that is stronger . Y ou will agree with
that, won’ t you? For example, if we compare the ‘company’
community with the ‘earth’ community , the sense of belonging
of someone who says ‘I am a member of this company’ would
be stronger . T o borrow your terminology , the distance and
depth of the interpersonal relations are completely dif ferent.It’ s only natural that when we search for a sense of belonging,
we will be attracted to the smaller community .
PHILOSOPHER:  That is a perceptive observation. So, let’ s
starting thinking about why we should be aware of multiple
and lar ger communities. As I stated earlier , all of us belong to
multiple communities. W e belong to our households, our
schools, our workplaces and the local societies and the
countries in which we live. This far you agree with, yes?
YOUTH:  Y es, I do.
PHILOSOPHER:  W ell, suppose that you, as a student, regarded
the community that is ‘school’ as absolute. In other words,
school is everything to you, your ‘I’ exists because of school,
and no other ‘I’ is possible without it. But naturally , there will
be occasions within that community when you run into
adversity . It could be getting bullied, or not being able to make
friends or keep up with your schoolwork, or not adapting to
the system of the school in the first place. That is to say , it’ s
possible that with regard to the community that is your school,
you won’ t have that ‘it’ s okay to be here’ sense of belonging.
YOUTH:  Y es, absolutely . That’ s quite possible.
PHILOSOPHER:  When that happens, if you are thinking of school
as being everything to you, you will end up without a sense of
belonging to anything. And then, you will escape within a
smaller community such as your home. Y ou will shut yourself
in, and maybe even turn to violence against members of your
own family . And by doing such things, you will be attempting
to gain a sense of belonging somehow . What I would like you
to focus on here, though, is that there is ‘a more separate
community’ and, moreover , that there is ‘a lar ger community’.
YOUTH:  What does that mean?
PHILOSOPHER:  That there is a lar ger world that extends far
beyond the confines of the school. And every one of us is a
member of that world. If there is no place of refuge in your
school, you should find a dif ferent refuge outside the walls of
the school. Y ou can change schools, and it’ s fine to withdraw
from school, too. A community that you can break relations
with by simply submitting a withdrawal notice is one that youcan have only so much connection to, in any case. Once you
know how big the world is, you will see that all the hardship
you went through in school was a storm in a teacup. The
moment you leave the teacup, that raging storm will be gone,
and a gentle breeze will greet you in its place.
YOUTH:  Are you saying that as long as you keep yourself shut
up inside the teacup, you’ll never stand a chance outside it?
PHILOSOPHER:  Secluding yourself in your room is akin to
staying in the teacup, as if you are hunkering down in a small
shelter . Y ou might be able to wait out the rain for a short
while, but the storm will continue unabated.
YOUTH:  W ell, maybe in theory , anyway . But it’ s hard to break
out. The decision to withdraw from school itself isn’ t
something to be taken lightly .
PHILOSOPHER:  I am sure you are right—it would not be easy .
Therefore, there is a principle of action that I would like you to
commit to memory . When we run into dif ficulties in our
interpersonal relations, or when we can no longer see a way
out, what we should consider first and foremost is the principle
that says ‘listen to the voice of the lar ger community’.
YOUTH:  The voice of the lar ger community?
PHILOSOPHER:  If it is a school, one does not judge things with
the commonsense of the community that is the school, but
instead follows the commonsense of a lar ger community . Now ,
let’ s say it’ s your school, and your teacher has been behaving
in an authoritarian manner . But the power or authority your
teacher wields is nothing more than an aspect of the
commonsense that operates only within the small community
that is the school. From the standpoint of the community that
is ‘human society’, both you and your teacher are equal
humans. If unreasonable demands are being thrust on you, it is
fine to object to them directly .
YOUTH:  But, it will be very dif ficult to object when the teacher
is right in front of me.
PHILOSOPHER:  Not at all. Though this might be termed a ‘you
and I’ relationship, if it is one that can break down justbecause you raise an objection, then it is not the sort of
relationship you need to get into in the first place. It is fine to
just let go of it. Living in fear of one’ s relationships falling
apart is an unfree way to live, in which one is living for other
people.
YOUTH:  Y ou’re saying to choose freedom at the same time that
I have community feeling?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, of course. Do not cling to the small
community right in front of you. There will always be more
‘you and I’, and more ‘everyone’, and lar ger communities that
exist.D O  N O  T R E B U K E  O R  P R A I S E
YOUTH:  W ell, all right. But don’ t you see? Y ou haven’ t touched
on the essential point; that is, the course of progression from
the separation of tasks to community feeling. So, first, I
separate the tasks. I think of my tasks as being up to this point;
and everything beyond that is other people’ s tasks. I don’ t
intervene in other people’ s tasks, and I draw a line so that
other people won’ t intervene in mine. But how can one build
interpersonal relations with this separation of tasks, and arrive
in the end at the community feeling that ‘it’ s okay to be here’?
How does Adlerian psychology advise us to overcome the life
tasks of work, friendship and love? It seems like you’re just
trying to confuse me with abstract words, without going into
any concrete explanation.
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, you’ve hit on the important point. How
does carrying out the separating of tasks connect with good
relations? That is to say , how does it connect with building the
kind of relations in which we cooperate and act in harmony
with each other? Which brings us to the concept of ‘horizontal
relationship’.
YOUTH:  Horizontal relationship?
PHILOSOPHER:  Let’ s start with an easily understood example,
that of the parent–child relationship. Whether the
circumstances are those of childrearing, or of training junior
staf f in the workplace, for example, generally speaking there
are two approaches that are considered: one is the method of
raising by rebuke, and the other is the method of raising by
praise.
YOUTH:  Ah. That is a hotly debated issue.
PHILOSOPHER:  Which one do you think is the better choice? T o
rebuke or to praise?
YOUTH:  It’ s better to raise by praising, of course.
PHILOSOPHER:  Why?YOUTH:  T ake animal training, for example. When teaching
animals to do tricks, you can make them obey with a whip.
This is the typical ‘raising by rebuke’ way . On the other hand,
it’ s also possible to get animals to learn tricks by holding up
rewards of food or saying kind words. This is ‘raising by
praise’. Both ways can lead to the same results—they learn
new tricks. But the motivation for moving toward the
objective is completely dif ferent if the animal is doing it
because it will be rebuked or doing it because it wants to be
praised. In the latter instance, it will come with a feeling of
joy . Rebuke only makes the animal wither . But raising with
praise naturally allows it to grow strong and healthy . This
seems like an obvious conclusion.
PHILOSOPHER:  Animal training is an interesting example. Now ,
let’ s look at this from the standpoint of Adlerian psychology .
In Adlerian psychology , we take the stance that in
childrearing, and in all other forms of communication with
other people, one must not praise.
YOUTH:  One must not praise?
PHILOSOPHER:  Physical punishment is out of the question, of
course, and rebuking is not accepted, either . One must not
praise, and one must not rebuke. That is the standpoint of
Adlerian psychology .
YOUTH:  But how is that even possible?
PHILOSOPHER:  Consider the reality of the act of praise. For
example, suppose I praised a statement you made by saying,
‘Good job!’ W ouldn’ t hearing those words seem strange
somehow?
YOUTH:  Y es, I guess it would put me in an unpleasant mood.
PHILOSOPHER:  Can you explain why it would feel unpleasant?
YOUTH:  What’ s unpleasant is the feeling that from the words
‘Good job!’ one is being talked down to.
PHILOSOPHER:  Exactly . In the act of praise, there is the aspect of
it being ‘the passing of judgement by a person of ability on a
person of no ability’. A mother praises her child who has
helped her prepare dinner , saying, ‘Y ou’re such a goodhelper!’ But when her husband does the same things, you can
be sure she won’ t be telling him, ‘Y ou’re such a good helper!’
YOUTH:  Ha-ha, you are right about that.
PHILOSOPHER:  In other words, the mother who praises the child
by saying things like ‘Y ou’re such a good helper!’ or ‘Good
job!’ or ‘W ell, aren’ t you something!’ is unconsciously
creating a hierarchical relationship and seeing the child as
beneath her . The example of animal training that you just gave
is also emblematic of the hierarchical relationship—the
vertical relationship—that is behind the praising. When one
person praises another , the goal is ‘to manipulate someone
who has less ability than you’. It is not done out of gratitude or
respect.
YOUTH:  So, you’re saying that one praises in order to
manipulate?
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right. Whether we praise or rebuke others,
the only dif ference is one of the carrot or the stick, and the
background goal is manipulation. The reason that Adlerian
psychology is highly critical of reward-and-punishment
education is that its intention is to manipulate children.
YOUTH:  No way , you’re wrong there. Because think of it from
the standpoint of the child. For children, isn’ t being praised by
their parents the greatest joy of all? It’ s because they want
praise that they do their studies. It’ s because they want praise
that they learn to behave properly . That’ s how it was for me
when I was a child. How I craved praise from my parents! And
even after becoming an adult, it’ s been the same way . When
your boss praises you, it feels good. That’ s how it is for
everyone. This has nothing to do with reason—it’ s just
instinctual emotion!
PHILOSOPHER:  One wishes to be praised by someone. Or
conversely , one decides to give praise to someone. This is
proof that one is seeing all interpersonal relationships as
‘vertical relationships’. This holds true for you, too: it is
because you are living in vertical relationships that you want
to be praised. Adlerian psychology refutes all manner of
vertical relationships, and proposes that all interpersonalrelationships be horizontal relationships. In a sense, this point
may be regarded as the fundamental principle of Adlerian
psychology .
YOUTH:  Is this something that is conveyed by the words ‘equal
but not the same’?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. Equal, that is to say , horizontal. For
example, there are men who verbally abuse their wives, who
do all the housework, with such remarks as, ‘Y ou’re not
bringing in any money , so I don’ t want to hear it’ or ‘It’ s
thanks to me that there’ s food on the table.’ And I’m sure
you’ve heard this one before: ‘Y ou have everything you need,
so what are you complaining about?’ It’ s perfectly shameful.
Such statements of economic superiority or the like have no
connection whatsoever to human worth. A company employee
and a full-time housewife simply have dif ferent workplaces
and roles, and are truly ‘equal but not the same’.
YOUTH:  I agree entirely .
PHILOSOPHER:  They are probably afraid that women will grow
wise to their situation and start earning more than men do, and
that women will start asserting themselves. They see all
interpersonal relations as vertical relationships, and they are
afraid of being seen by women as beneath them. That is to say ,
they have intense, hidden feelings of inferiority .
YOUTH:  So, in a sense, they are getting into a superiority
complex in which they are trying to make a show of their
abilities?
PHILOSOPHER:  So it seems. In the first place, the feeling of
inferiority is an awareness that arises within vertical
relationships. If one can build horizontal relationships that are
‘equal but not the same’ for all people, there will no longer be
any room for inferiority complexes to emer ge.
YOUTH:  Hmm. Maybe I do have an awareness of manipulation
somewhere in my psyche when I go about praising other
people. Laying on the flattery to get in good favour with my
boss—that’ s definitely manipulation, isn’ t it? And it’ s the
other way around, too. I’ve been manipulated by being praised
by others. Funny , I guess that’ s just the sort of person I am!PHILOSOPHER:  Y es; in the sense that you have not been able to
break out of vertical relationships, it would seem so.
YOUTH:  This is getting interesting! Please go on!T H E  E N C O U R A G E M E N T
A P P R O A C H
PHILOSOPHER:  As you may recall from our discussion on the
separation of tasks, I brought up the subject of intervention.
This is the act of intruding on other people’ s tasks. So, why
does a person intervene? Here, too, in the background, vertical
relationships are at play . It is precisely because one perceives
interpersonal relations as vertical, and sees the other party as
beneath one, that one intervenes. Through intervention, one
tries to lead the other party in the desired direction. One has
convinced oneself that one is right, and that the other party is
wrong. Of course, the intervention here is manipulation, pure
and simple. Parents commanding a child to study is a typical
example of this. They might be acting out of the best of
intentions from their points of view , but, when it comes down
to it, the parents are intruding, and attempting to manipulate
the child to go in their desired direction.
YOUTH:  If one can build horizontal relationships, will that
intervention disappear?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, it will.
YOUTH:  W ell, it’ s one thing if you’re just talking about a child’ s
studies. But when someone’ s suf fering right there in front of
you, you can’ t just leave them be, can you? W ould you still
say that lending a helping hand is intervention, and then do
nothing?
PHILOSOPHER:  One must not let it go unnoticed. It is necessary
to of fer assistance that does not turn into intervention.
YOUTH:  What is the dif ference between intervention and
assistance?
PHILOSOPHER:  Think back to our discussion of the separation of
tasks; to the subject of a child’ s schoolwork. As I stated then,
this is a task that the child has to resolve himself, not
something that parents or teachers can do for him. So,
intervention is this kind of intruding on other people’ s tasks,and directing them by saying things like, ‘Y ou have to study ,’
or ‘Get into that university .’ Whereas, assistance, on the other
hand, presupposes the separation of tasks, and also horizontal
relationships. Having understood that studying is the child’ s
task, one considers what one can do for him. Concretely
speaking, instead of commanding from above that the child
must study , one acts on him in such a way that he can gain the
confidence to take care of his own studies and face his tasks
on his own.
YOUTH:  And that action isn’ t forced?
PHILOSOPHER:  No, it’ s not. W ithout forcing, and with the tasks
always kept separate, one assists the child to resolve them by
his own ef forts. It’ s the approach of ‘you can lead a horse to
water , but you can’ t make him drink’. He is the one who has to
face his tasks, and he is the one who makes the resolution.
YOUTH:  So, you neither praise nor rebuke?
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right, one neither praises nor rebukes.
This kind of assistance, which is based on horizontal
relationships, is referred to in Adlerian psychology as
‘encouragement’.
YOUTH:  Encouragement, huh? Right, that’ s the term you
mentioned some time ago. Y ou said you’d explain at a later
date.
PHILOSOPHER:  When one is not following through with one’ s
tasks, it is not because one is without ability . Adlerian
psychology tells us that the issue here is not one of ability , but
simply that ‘one has lost the courage  to face one’ s tasks’. And,
if that is the case, the thing to do before anything else is to
recover that lost courage.
YOUTH:  But, but we’re just going around in circles! That’ s
basically the same as giving praise. When one is praised by
another person, one becomes truly aware of one’ s ability and
regains one’ s courage. Please do not be stubborn about this
point—just acknowledge the necessity of giving praise.
PHILOSOPHER:  No, I will not acknowledge that.
YOUTH:  Why not?PHILOSOPHER:  The reason is clear . Being praised is what leads
people to form the belief that they have no ability .
YOUTH:  What did you say?
PHILOSOPHER:  Shall I repeat myself? The more one is praised
by another person, the more one forms the belief that one has
no ability . Please do your best to remember this.
YOUTH:  Do such foolish people even exist? It’ s got to be the
other way around! It is as a result of being praised that one
becomes truly aware of one’ s ability . Isn’ t that obvious?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y ou are wrong. Even if you do derive joy from
being praised, it is the same as being dependent on vertical
relationships, and acknowledging that you have no ability .
Because giving praise is a judgement that is passed by a
person of ability onto a person without ability .
YOUTH:  I just cannot agree with that.
PHILOSOPHER:  When receiving praise becomes one’ s goal, one
is choosing a way of living that is in line with another person’ s
system of values. Looking at your life until now , aren’ t you
tired of trying to live up to your parents’ expectations?
YOUTH:  Um, well, I guess so.
PHILOSOPHER:  First, do the separation of tasks. Then, while
accepting each other ’ s dif ferences, build equal horizontal
relationships. Encouragement is the approach that comes next.H O W  T O  F E E L  Y O U  H A V E
V A L U E
YOUTH:  So, concretely speaking, how does one go about this?
One cannot praise, and one cannot rebuke. What other words
and choices are there?
PHILOSOPHER:  Think about a time when you’ve had help in
your work—not from a child, but from a partner who is your
equal—and you will probably see the answer right away .
When a friend helps you clean your home, what do you say to
him?
YOUTH:  I say , ‘Thank you.’
PHILOSOPHER:  Right. Y ou convey words of gratitude, saying
thank you to this partner who has helped you with your work.
Y ou might express straightforward delight: ‘I’m glad.’ Or you
could convey your thanks by saying, ‘That was a big help.’
This is an approach to encouragement that is based on
horizontal relationships.
YOUTH:  That’ s all?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. The most important thing is to not judge
other people. Judgement is a word that comes out of vertical
relationships. If one is building horizontal relationships, there
will be words of more straightforward gratitude and respect
and joy .
YOUTH:  Hmm, your point that judgement is created by vertical
relationships certainly seems to be true. But, what about this?
Could the words ‘thank you’ actually have such a great power
as to be able to bring back courage? After all, I think I’d prefer
to be praised, even if the words I hear are ones that come from
vertical relationships.
PHILOSOPHER:  Being praised essentially means that one is
receiving judgement from another person as ‘good’. And the
measure of what is good or bad about that act is that person’ s
yardstick. If receiving praise is what one is after , one will have
no choice but to adapt to that person’ s yardstick and put thebrakes on one’ s own freedom. ‘Thank you’, on the other hand,
rather than being judgement, is a clear expression of gratitude.
When one hears words of gratitude, one knows that one has
made a contribution to another person.
YOUTH:  So, even if you’re judged as ‘good’ by another person,
you don’ t feel that you’ve made a contribution?
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right. This is a point that will connect to
our subsequent discussion as well—in Adlerian psychology , a
great deal of emphasis is given to ‘contribution’.
YOUTH:  Why is that?
PHILOSOPHER:  W ell, what does a person have to do to get
courage ? In Adler ’ s view , ‘It is only when a person is able to
feel that he has worth that he can possess courage.’
YOUTH:  When a person is able to feel that he has worth?
PHILOSOPHER:  Do you recall when we were discussing the
feeling of inferiority , how I spoke of this as being an issue of
subjective worth? Is one able to feel one has worth, or does
one feel one is a worthless being? If one is able to feel one has
worth, then one can accept oneself just as one is and have the
courage to face one’ s life tasks. So, the issue that arises at this
point is, how on earth can one become able to feel one has
worth?
YOUTH:  Y es, that’ s it exactly! I need you to explain that very
clearly , please.
PHILOSOPHER:  It’ s quite simple. It is when one is able to feel I
am beneficial to the community  that one can have a true sense
of one’ s worth. This is the answer that would be of fered in
Adlerian psychology .
YOUTH:  That I am beneficial to the community?
PHILOSOPHER:  That one can act on the community; that is to
say , on other people, and that one can feel I am of use to
someone . Instead of feeling judged by another person as
‘good’, being able to feel, by way of one’ s own subjective
viewpoint, that I can make contributions to other people . It is
at that point that, at last, we can have a true sense of our ownworth. Everything we have been discussing about community
feeling and encouragement connects here.
YOUTH:  Hmm. I don’ t know , it’ s starting to get a bit confusing.
PHILOSOPHER:  W e are getting to the heart of the discussion now .
Please stick with me a while longer . It is about having concern
for others, building horizontal relationships and taking the
approach of encouragement. All these things connect to the
deep life awareness of ‘I am of use to someone’, and in turn, to
your courage to live.
YOUTH:  T o be of use to someone. That is what my life is worth
living for … ?
PHILOSOPHER:  Let’ s take a little break. W ould you like some
cof fee?
YOUTH:  Y es, please.
The discussion of community feeling had become mor e
confusing than ever . One must not praise. And one must
not r ebuke, either . All words that ar e used to judge other
people ar e words that come out of vertical r elationships,
and we need to build horizontal r elationships. And it is
only when one is able to feel that one is of use to someone
that one can have a true awar eness of one’ s worth. Ther e
was a major flaw in this logic somewher e. The young man
felt it instinctively . As he sipped the hot coffee, thoughts of
his grandfather cr ossed his mind.E X I S T  I N  T H E  P R E S E N T
PHILOSOPHER:  W ell, have you worked things out?
YOUTH:  Gradually , but yes, it’ s getting clearer . Y ou don’ t seem
to be aware of it, but just now you said something really over
the top. It’ s a dangerous, rather extreme opinion that just
negates everything in the world.
PHILOSOPHER:  Oh, really? What is it?
YOUTH:  It’ s the idea that being of use to someone is what gives
one a true awareness of one’ s worth. If you put it the other
way around, a person who isn’ t of any use to others has no
worth at all. That’ s what you are saying, isn’ t it? If one takes
that to its logical conclusion then the lives of newborn babies,
and of invalids and old people who are bedridden, aren’ t worth
living either . How could this be? Let’ s talk about my
grandfather . He spends his days bedridden at an old people’ s
home. Since he has dementia, he doesn’ t recognise any of his
children or grandchildren, and his condition is such that he
would not be able to go on living without constant care. One
simply couldn’ t think of him as being of use to someone.
Don’ t you see? Y our opinion is basically the same thing as
saying to my grandfather , ‘People like you aren’ t qualified to
live!’
PHILOSOPHER:  I reject that definitively .
YOUTH:  How do you reject that?
PHILOSOPHER:  There are parents who refute my explanation of
the concept of encouragement by saying, ‘Our child does bad
things from morning to night, and there is never an occasion to
tell him, “Thank you” or “Y ou helped a lot.”’ The context is
probably the same as what you are talking about, isn’ t it?
YOUTH:  Y es, it is. So, tell me please how you justify that.
PHILOSOPHER:  At this point, you are looking at another person
on the level of his acts. In other words, that that person ‘did
something’. So, from that point of view , it might seem that
bedridden old people are only a nuisance, and are of no use toanyone. So, let’ s look at other people not on the ‘level of acts’,
but on the ‘level of being’. W ithout judging whether or not
other people did something, one rejoices in their being there,
in their very existence, and one calls out to them with words of
gratitude.
YOUTH:  Y ou call out to their existence? What on earth are you
talking about?
PHILOSOPHER:  If you consider things at the level of being, we
are of use to others and have worth just by being here. This is
an indisputable fact.
YOUTH:  No way! Enough joking around. Being of use to
someone just by being here—that’ s got to be straight out of
some new religion.
PHILOSOPHER:  W ell, for example, suppose your mother has a
car accident. Her condition is serious, and her life may be in
danger . At a time like that, you would not be wondering if
your mother ‘did something’, or anything of the sort. More
than likely , you will just be thinking you’ll be glad if she
makes it, and you’re glad she is holding on right now .
YOUTH:  Of course I would!
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s what it means to be grateful on the level
of being. Y our mother might not be able to do anything in her
critical condition that would be considered an act, but just by
being alive, she would be supporting the psychological state of
you and your family , and would therefore be of use. The same
could be said for you, too. If your life were in danger , and you
were hanging on by a thread, the people around you would
probably feel very gladdened just by the very fact of your
existing. They would simply feel thankful that you are safe in
the here and now , and would not be wanting you to perform
some direct act. At the very least, there is no reason they
would have to think that way . So, instead of thinking of
oneself on the level of acts, first of all one accepts oneself on
the level of being.
YOUTH:  That’ s an extreme example—everyday life is dif ferent.
PHILOSOPHER:  No, it is the same.YOUTH:  What is the same about it? T ry and give me a more
everyday example, please. If you can’ t, I won’ t be able to
agree with this.
PHILOSOPHER:  All right. When we look at other people, we are
prone to construct our own ideal images of ourselves, which
we then detract from and judge. Imagine, for example, a child
who never talks back to his parents, excels in both schoolwork
and sports, attends a good university , and joins a lar ge
company . There are parents who will compare their child to
such an image of an ideal child—which is an impossible
fiction—and then be filled with complaints and dissatisfaction.
They treat the idealised image as one hundred points, and they
gradually subtract from that. This is truly a ‘judgement’ way
of thinking. Instead, the parents could refrain from comparing
their child to anyone else, see him for who he actually is, and
be glad and grateful for his being there. Instead of taking away
points from some idealised image, they could start from zero.
And if they do that, they should be able to call out to his
existence itself.
YOUTH:  Okay , but I’d say that’ s just an idealistic approach. So,
are you saying that even with the kind of child who never goes
to school or gets a job, but just shuts himself in and stays
home, one should still communicate one’ s gratitude and say
‘thank you’?
PHILOSOPHER:  Of course. Suppose your shut-in child helped
you wash the dishes after a meal. If you were to say then,
‘Enough of that already—just go to school,’ you would be
using the words of such parents who detract from an image of
an ideal child. If you were to take such an approach, the child
would probably end up even more discouraged. However , if
you can say a straightforward ‘thank you’, the child just might
feel his own worth, and take a new step forward.
YOUTH:  That’ s just utterly hypocritical! It’ s nothing more than
the nonsensical talk of a hypocrite. It sounds like the
‘neighbourly love’ that Christians talk about. The community
feeling, the horizontal relationships, the gratitude for existence
and so on. Who on earth could actually do such things?PHILOSOPHER:  W ith regard to this issue of community feeling,
there was a person who asked Adler a similar question.
Adler ’ s reply was the following: ‘Someone has to start. Other
people might not be cooperative, but that is not connected to
you. My advice is this: you should start. W ith no regard to
whether others are cooperative or not.’ My advice is exactly
the same.P E O P L E  C A N N O T  M A K E
P R O P E R  U S E  O F  S E L F
YOUTH:  I should start?
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right. W ithout regard to whether other
people are cooperative or not.
YOUTH:  All right, I’ll ask you again. ‘People can be of use to
someone else simply by being alive, and have a true sense of
their worth just by being alive.’ Is that what you are saying?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es.
YOUTH:  W ell, I don’ t know . I am alive, right here and now . ‘I’,
who is no one else but me, am alive right here. But even so, I
don’ t really feel that I have worth.
PHILOSOPHER:  Can you describe in words why you do not feel
that you have worth?
YOUTH:  I suppose it’ s what you’ve been referring to as
interpersonal relations. From childhood up to the present, I
have always been belittled by people around me, especially
my parents, as a poor excuse for a little brother . They have
never really tried to recognise me for who I am. Y ou say that
worth is something one gives to oneself. But that’ s just an
impracticable theory . For example, at the library where I work,
for the most part my job is just sorting the returned books and
putting them back on the shelves. It’ s routine work that anyone
could do once they’ve been taught. If I stopped going to work,
my boss would have no trouble finding someone to replace
me. I am needed only for the unskilled labour I provide, and it
doesn’ t actually matter at all if it is ‘I’ who is working there or
someone else, or a machine for that matter . No one is requiring
‘this me’ in particular . In such circumstances, would you have
confidence in yourself? W ould you be able to have a true sense
of worth?
PHILOSOPHER:  From an Adlerian psychology point of view , the
answer is simple. First of all, build a horizontal relationshipbetween yourself and another person. One is enough. Let’ s
start from there.
YOUTH:  Please don’ t treat me like a fool! Look, I have friends.
And I am building solid horizontal relationships with them.
PHILOSOPHER:  Even so, I suspect that with your parents and
your boss, and with your junior colleagues and other people as
well, the relationships you are building are vertical ones.
YOUTH:  Of course, I have dif ferent kinds of relationships.
That’ s how it is for everyone.
PHILOSOPHER:  This is a very important point. Does one build
vertical relationships, or does one build horizontal
relationships? This is an issue of lifestyle, and human beings
are not so clever as to be able to have dif ferent lifestyles
available whenever the need arises. In other words, deciding
that one is ‘equal to this person’ or ‘in a hierarchical
relationship with that person’ does not work.
YOUTH:  Do you mean that one has to choose one or the other—
vertical relationships or horizontal relationships?
PHILOSOPHER:  Absolutely , yes. If you are building even one
vertical relationship with someone, before you even notice
what is happening, you will be treating all your interpersonal
relations as vertical.
YOUTH:  So, I am treating even my relationships with my
friends as vertical?
PHILOSOPHER:  That is correct. Even if you are not treating them
in a boss-or -subordinate kind of way , it is as if you are saying,
‘A is above me, and B is below me,’ for example, or ‘I’ll
follow A ’ s advice, but ignore what B says,’ or ‘I don’ t mind
breaking my promise to C.’
YOUTH:  Hmm!
PHILOSOPHER:  On the other hand, if one has managed to build a
horizontal relationship with at least one person—if one has
been able to build a relationship of equals in the true sense of
the term—that is a major lifestyle transformation. W ith that
breakthrough, all one’ s interpersonal relations will gradually
become horizontal.YOUTH:  What nonsense! There are so many ways I could refute
that. Think of a company setting, for example. It wouldn’ t
really be feasible for the director and his new recruits to form
relationships as equals, would it? Hierarchical relationships
are part of the system of our society , and to ignore that is to
ignore the social order . Look, if you heard that a new recruit at
your company , who’ s only twenty or so, had suddenly started
buddying up to the sixty-something director , don’ t you think it
would sound pretty far -fetched?
PHILOSOPHER:  It is certainly important to respect one’ s elders.
In a company structure, it is only natural for there to be
dif ferent levels of responsibility . I am not telling you to make
friends with everyone, or behave as if you are close friends.
Rather , what is important is to be equal in consciousness, and
to assert that which needs to be asserted.
YOUTH:  I am not someone who can mouth of f to my seniors,
and I would never think of trying. My social commonsense
would be called into question if I did.
PHILOSOPHER:  What is ‘senior ’? What is this ‘mouthing of f ’? If
one is gauging the atmosphere of a situation and being
dependent on vertical relationships, one is engaging in
irresponsible acts—one is trying to avoid one’ s
responsibilities.
YOUTH:  What is irresponsible about it?
PHILOSOPHER:  Suppose that as a result of following your boss’ s
instructions, your work ends in failure. Whose responsibility is
it then?
YOUTH:  W ell, that’d be my boss’ s responsibility . Because I was
just following orders, and he was the one who decided on
them.
PHILOSOPHER:  None of the responsibility is yours?
YOUTH:  No, it isn’ t. It’ s the responsibility of the boss who gave
the orders. This is what’ s known as or ganisational
accountability .
PHILOSOPHER:  Y ou are wrong. That is a life-lie. There is  space
for you to refuse, and there should also be space to propose abetter way of doing things. Y ou are just thinking there is no
space to refuse so that you can avoid the conflict of the
associated interpersonal relations and avoid responsibility—
and you are being dependent on vertical relationships.
YOUTH:  Are you saying I should disobey my boss? Sure, in
theory , I should. Theoretically , it’ s exactly as you say . But I
can’ t do that! There’ s no way I could build a relationship like
that.
PHILOSOPHER:  Really? Y ou are building a horizontal
relationship with me right now . Y ou are asserting yourself very
well. Instead of thinking about this or that dif ficulty , you can
just start here.
YOUTH:  I can start here?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, in this small study . As I told you earlier , to
me, you are an irreplaceable friend.
YOUTH:  …
PHILOSOPHER:  Am I wrong?
YOUTH:  I appreciate it, I really do. But I am afraid. I am afraid
of accepting your proposal.
PHILOSOPHER:  What are you afraid of, exactly?
YOUTH:  The tasks of friendship, naturally . I have never
befriended an older man like you. I have no idea if a friend
relationship with such a dif ference in age is even possible, or
if I had better think of it as a student–teacher relationship.
PHILOSOPHER:  Age does not matter in love and friendship. It is
certainly true that the tasks of friendship require a steady
courage. W ith regard to your relationship with me, it will be
fine to reduce the distance little by little. T o a degree of
distance in which we are not in very close contact, but can still
reach out and touch each other ’ s faces with our outstretched
arms, so to speak.
YOUTH:  Please give me some time. Just once more, I would
like some time to try to figure things out on my own. Our
discussion today has given me much to think about. I would
like to take it all home and ruminate on it calmly on my own.PHILOSOPHER:  It takes time to gain a true understanding of
community feeling. It would be quite impossible to understand
everything about it right here and now . Please return to your
home and give it some careful thought, while checking it
against everything else we have discussed.
YOUTH:  I will. In any case, it was quite a blow to be told that I
never really look at others, and I only have concern for myself.
Y ou’re really a dreadful fellow!
PHILOSOPHER:  Ha-ha. Y ou say it in such a happy way .
YOUTH:  Y es, I enjoy it immensely . It hurts, of course. It’ s like a
sharp pain that shoots through me, as if I were swallowing
needles. But still, I enjoy it immensely . It’ s habit-forming,
having these discussions with you. I realised a little while ago
that maybe I don’ t just want to take apart your ar gument—I
want you to take apart mine, too.
PHILOSOPHER:  I see. That’ s an interesting analysis.
YOUTH:  But don’ t for get. I told you that I am going to take
apart your ar gument and bring you to your knees, and I
haven’ t given up.
PHILOSOPHER:  Thank you. I’ve had a good time, too. Come by
whenever you’re ready to pick this back up.The young man thought to himself: Adlerian psychology is
engaged in a thorough inquiry into interpersonal
relationships. And the final goal of these interpersonal
relationships is community feeling. But is this really
enough? Isn’ t there something else that I was brought into
this world to achieve? What is the meaning of life? Where
am I headed, and what sort of life am I trying to lead?  The
mor e the young man thought, the mor e it seemed to him
that his own existence had been tiny and insignificant.E X C E S S I V E  S E L F -
C O N S C I O U S N E S S  S T I F L E S  T H E
S E L F
PHILOSOPHER:  It’ s been a while, hasn’ t it?
YOUTH:  Y es, I last came about a month ago. I have been
thinking about the meaning of community feeling since then.
PHILOSOPHER:  So, how do you feel about it now?
YOUTH:  W ell, community feeling is definitely an attractive
idea. The sense of belonging, that ‘it’ s okay to be here’, for
example, which we possess as a fundamental desire. I think it
is a brilliant insight into our existence as social creatures.
PHILOSOPHER:  It’ s a brilliant insight, except … ?
YOUTH:  Funny , you caught on right away . That’ s right, I still
have some issues with it. I’ll say it straight out—I have no idea
what you are going on about with your references to the
universe and all that, and it ends up reeking of religion from
beginning to end. There’ s this kind of cultish quality to it all
that I just can’ t shake.
PHILOSOPHER:  When Adler first proposed the concept of
community feeling, there was a great deal of opposition in a
similar vein. People said that psychology is supposed to be a
science, and here was Adler discussing the issue of worth.
That sort of thing isn’ t science, they said.
YOUTH:  So, in my own way , I tried to figure out why I couldn’ t
understand what you were talking about, and I’m thinking that
the order of things might be the problem. Y ou’re starting of f
with the universe and inanimate objects, and the past and the
future and so on, so I lose track of things. Instead, one should
get a firm grasp of the ‘I’. Next, one should contemplate one-
on-one relationships. That is to say , the interpersonal
relationships of ‘you and I’. And once one has done that, the
lar ger community should come into view .
PHILOSOPHER:  I see. That is a good order .YOUTH:  Now , the first thing I want to ask about is attachment
to self. Y ou are saying that one has to stop being attached to
the ‘I’ and make the switch to ‘concern for others’. I am sure it
is exactly as you say—concern for others is important, I agree.
But no matter what, we worry about ourselves; we look at
ourselves all the time.
PHILOSOPHER:  Have you thought about why we worry about
ourselves?
YOUTH:  I have. If I were a narcissist, for example—if I were in
love with myself and constantly fascinated with myself—
maybe that would simplify things. Because your instruction,
‘have more concern for others’, is a perfectly sound one. But I
am not a self-loving narcissist. I am a self-loathing realist. I
hate who I am, and that’ s exactly why I look at myself all the
time. I don’ t have confidence in myself, and that’ s why I am
excessively self-conscious.
PHILOSOPHER:  At what times do you feel that you are
excessively self-conscious?
YOUTH:  W ell, at meetings for example, I have a hard time
raising my hand and making myself heard. I think needless
things, like If I ask this question, they’ll pr obably laugh at me
or If the point I want to make is irr elevant, I’ll get ridiculed ,
and so on, and I just clam up. T ruthfully , I falter even when it
comes to telling silly jokes in front of people. Every time, my
self-consciousness kicks in and puts the brakes on, and it’ s as
if I’ve been straightjacketed. My self-consciousness won’ t
allow me to behave in an innocent way . But I don’ t even have
to ask for your answer . I’m sure it’ll be the same as always:
have courage. But you know , such words are of no use to me.
Because this isn’ t just a matter of courage.
PHILOSOPHER:  I see. Last time, I gave an overview of
community feeling. T oday , we will dig deeper .
YOUTH:  And where will that take us?
PHILOSOPHER:  W e will probably arrive at the question, what is
happiness?
YOUTH:  Oh! So, happiness lies beyond community feeling?PHILOSOPHER:  There is no need to rush the answers. What we
need is dialogue.
YOUTH:  All right, then. So, let’ s get started!N O T  S E L F - A F F I R M A T I O N —
S E L F - A C C E P T A N C E
PHILOSOPHER:  First of all, let’ s look at what you were just
saying, about your self-consciousness putting the brakes on
and not letting you behave in an innocent way . There are
probably many people who experience this trouble. So, let’ s go
back to the source again, and think about your goal. What
could you be trying to gain by putting the brakes on your own
innocent behaviour?
YOUTH:  It’ s the genuine desire to not be laughed at; to not be
thought of as a fool.
PHILOSOPHER:  So, in other words, you do not have confidence
in your innocent self; in yourself just as you are, right? And
you stay away from the kind of interpersonal relationship in
which you would just be yourself. But I’ll bet that when
you’re home alone, you sing out loud and dance to music, and
speak in a lively voice.
YOUTH:  Ha-ha! It’ s almost like you’ve set up a surveillance
camera in my room! But yes, it’ s true. I can behave freely
when I’m alone.
PHILOSOPHER:  Anyone can behave like a king when they’re
alone. So, this is an issue that should be considered in the
context of interpersonal relations. Because it isn’ t that you
don’ t have an innocent self—it is only that you can’ t do such
things in front of others.
YOUTH:  W ell, what should I do then?
PHILOSOPHER:  It’ s about community feeling, after all.
Concretely speaking, it’ s making the switch from attachment
to self (self-interest) to concern for others (social interest), and
gaining a sense of community feeling. Three things are needed
at this point: ‘self-acceptance’, ‘confidence in others’ and
‘contribution to others’.
YOUTH:  Interesting. New keywords, I see. What do they refer
to?PHILOSOPHER:  Let’ s start with self-acceptance. On our first
night, I brought up that statement of Adler ’ s: ‘The important
thing is not what one is born with, but what use one makes of
that equipment.’ Do you remember this?
YOUTH:  Y es, of course.
PHILOSOPHER:  W e cannot discard the receptacle that is the ‘I’,
and neither can we replace it. The important thing, however , is
‘what use one makes of that equipment’. One changes one’ s
way of looking at the ‘I’— that is to say , one changes how one
uses it.
YOUTH:  Does that mean be more positive and have a stronger
sense of self-af firmation? Think about everything more
positively?
PHILOSOPHER:  There is no need to go out of one’ s way to be
positive and af firm oneself. It’ s not self-af firmation that we are
concerned with, but self-acceptance.
YOUTH:  Not self-af firmation, but self-acceptance?
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right. There is a clear dif ference. Self-
af firmation is making suggestions to oneself, such as ‘I can do
it’ or ‘I am strong’, even when something is simply beyond
one’ s ability . It is a notion that can bring about a superiority
complex, and may even be termed a way of living in which
one lies to oneself. W ith self-acceptance, on the other hand, if
one cannot do something, one is simply accepting ‘one’ s
incapable self ’ as is, and moving forward so that one can do
whatever one can. It is not a way of lying to oneself. T o put it
more simply , say you’ve got a score of sixty per cent, but you
tell yourself I just happened to get unlucky this time ar ound,
and the r eal me is one hundr ed per cent . That is self-
af firmation. By contrast, if one accepts oneself as one is, as
sixty per cent, and thinks to oneself, How should I go about
getting closer to one hundr ed per cent? —that is self-
acceptance.
YOUTH:  So, even if you’re only sixty per cent, there’ s no need
to be pessimistic?PHILOSOPHER:  Of course not. No one is perfect. Do you recall
what I said when I was explaining the pursuit of superiority?
That all people are in this condition of wanting to improve?
Put the other way around, there is no such thing as a one
hundred per cent person. This is something we should actively
acknowledge.
YOUTH:  Hmm. What you are saying sounds positive in various
respects, but has a negative ring to it as well.
PHILOSOPHER:  Here, I use the term ‘af firmative resignation’.
YOUTH:  Af firmative resignation?
PHILOSOPHER:  This is also the case with the separation of tasks
—one ascertains the things one can change and the things one
cannot change. One cannot change what one is born with. But
one can, under one’ s own power , go about changing what use
one makes of that equipment. So, in that case, one simply has
to focus on what one can change, rather than on what one
cannot. This is what I call self-acceptance.
YOUTH:  What one can change, and what one cannot.
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right. Accept what is irreplaceable.
Accept ‘this me’ just as it is. And have the courage  to change
what one can change. That is self-acceptance.
YOUTH:  Hmm. That reminds me of a line that the writer Kurt
V onnegut quoted in one of his books: ‘God grant me the
serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to
change the things I can, and wisdom always to tell the
dif ference.’ It’ s in the novel Slaughter house-Five .
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, I know it. It is the Serenity Prayer . These
words are well known, and have been transmitted for many
years in Christian societies.
YOUTH:  He even used the word courage . I read the book so
intently I should know it by heart. But I never noticed this
point until now .
PHILOSOPHER:  It’ s true. W e do not lack ability . W e just lack
courage . It all comes down to courage .T H E  D I F F E R E N C E  B E T W E E N
T R U S T  A N D  C O N F I D E N C E
YOUTH:  There is something about this ‘af firmative resignation’
that sounds pessimistic. It’ s just too bleak if the upshot of all
this lengthy discussion is resignation.
PHILOSOPHER:  Is that so? Resignation has the connotation of
seeing clearly with fortitude and acceptance. Having a firm
grasp on the truth of things—that is resignation. There is
nothing pessimistic about it.
YOUTH:  A firm grasp on the truth …
PHILOSOPHER:  Of course, just because one has arrived at
af firmative resignation as one’ s self-acceptance, it does not
automatically follow that one finds community feeling. That is
the reality . When one is switching from attachment to self to
concern for others, the second key concept—confidence in
others—becomes absolutely essential.
YOUTH:  Confidence in others. In other words, believing  in
others?
PHILOSOPHER:  Here, I will consider the words ‘believing in
others’ in the context of distinguishing trust from confidence.
First, when we speak of trust, we are referring to something
that comes with set conditions. In English, it is referred to as
credit. For example, when one wants to borrow money from a
bank, one has to have some kind of security . The bank
calculates the amount of the loan based on the value of that
security , and says, ‘W e will lend you this much.’ The attitude
of ‘we will lend it to you on the condition that you will pay it
back,’ or ‘we will lend you as much as you are able to pay
back,’ is not one of having confidence in someone. It is trust.
YOUTH:  W ell, that’ s how bank financing works, I guess.
PHILOSOPHER:  By contrast, from the standpoint of Adlerian
psychology , the basis of interpersonal relations is not founded
on trust but on confidence.
YOUTH:  And ‘confidence’ in this case is … ?PHILOSOPHER:  It is doing without any set conditions whatsoever
when believing in others. Even if one does not have suf ficient
objective grounds for trusting someone, one believes. One
believes unconditionally without concerning oneself with such
things as security . That is confidence.
YOUTH:  Believing unconditionally? So, it’ s back to your pet
notion of neighbourly love?
PHILOSOPHER:  Of course, if one believes in others without
setting any conditions whatsoever , there will be times when
one gets taken advantage of. Just like the guarantor of a debt,
there are times when one may suf fer damages. The attitude of
continuing to believe in someone even in such instances is
what we call confidence.
YOUTH:  Only a naïve dimwit would do such a thing! I guess
you hold with the doctrine of innate human goodness, while I
hold with the doctrine of innate human evilness. Believe
unconditionally in complete strangers, and you’ll just get used
and abused.
PHILOSOPHER:  And there are also times when someone deceives
you, and you get used that way . But look at it from the
standpoint of someone who has been taken advantage of.
There are people who will continue to believe in you
unconditionally even if you are the one who has taken
advantage of them. People who will have confidence in you no
matter how they are treated. W ould you be able to betray such
a person again and again?
YOUTH:  Um, no. W ell, it would be …
PHILOSOPHER:  I am sure it would be quite dif ficult for you to do
such a thing.
YOUTH:  After all that, are you saying one has to appeal to the
emotions? T o keep on holding the faith, like a saint, and act on
the conscience of the other person? Y ou’re telling me that
morals don’ t matter to Adler , but isn’ t that exactly what we’re
talking about here?
PHILOSOPHER:  No, it is not. What would you say is the opposite
of confidence?YOUTH:  An antonym of confidence? Uh …
PHILOSOPHER:  It is doubt. Suppose you have placed ‘doubt’ at
the foundation of your interpersonal relations. That you live
your life doubting other people—doubting your friends, and
even your family and those you love. What sort of relationship
could possibly arise from that? The other person will detect
the doubt in your eyes in an instant. He or she will have an
instinctive understanding that ‘this person does not have
confidence in me’. Do you think one would be able to build
some kind of positive relationship from that point? It is
precisely because we lay a foundation of unconditional
confidence that it is possible for us to build a deep
relationship.
YOUTH:  Okay , I guess.
PHILOSOPHER:  The way to understand Adlerian psychology is
simple. Right now , you are thinking, If I wer e to have
confidence in someone unconditionally , I would just get taken
advantage of . However , you are not the one who decides
whether or not to take advantage. That is the other person’ s
task. All you need to do is think, What should I do?  If you are
telling yourself, I’ll give it to him if he isn’ t going take
advantage of me , it is just a relationship of trust that is based
on security or conditions.
YOUTH:  So, one separates tasks there, too?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. As I have stated repeatedly , carrying out the
separation of tasks returns life to an astonishingly simple form.
But while the principle of the separation of tasks is easy to
grasp, putting it into practice is dif ficult. I recognise that.
YOUTH:  Then, you are telling me to keep on having confidence
in everyone; to keep on believing in all other people even
when they deceive me, and just go on being a naïve fool?
That’ s not philosophy or psychology or anything of the sort—
it’ s just the preaching of a zealot!
PHILOSOPHER:  I reject that definitively . Adlerian psychology is
not saying ‘have confidence in others unconditionally’ on the
basis of a moralistic system of values. Unconditional
confidence is a means for making your interpersonalrelationship with a person better , and for building a horizontal
relationship. If you do not have the desire to make your
relationship with that person better , then go ahead and sever it.
Because carrying out the severing is your task.
YOUTH:  Then, what if I’ve placed unconditional confidence in
a friend in order to make our relationship better? I’ve jumped
through all sorts of hoops for this friend, gladly satisfied any
requests for money , and been unstinting with my time and
ef forts in his regard. But even in such cases, there are times
when one is taken advantage of. For example, if one were
horribly taken advantage of by a person one has believed in
completely , wouldn’ t that experience lead one to a lifestyle
with an ‘other people are my enemies’ outlook?
PHILOSOPHER:  It seems that you have not yet gained an
understanding of the goal of confidence. Suppose, for
example, that you are in a love relationship, but you are having
doubts about your partner and you think to yourself, I’ll bet
she’ s cheating on me . And you start making desperate ef forts
in search of evidence to prove that. What do you think would
happen as a result?
YOUTH:  W ell, I guess that would depend on the situation.
PHILOSOPHER:  No, in every instance, you would find an
abundance of evidence that she has been cheating on you.
YOUTH:  W ait? Why is that?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y our partner ’ s casual remarks, her tone when
talking to someone on the phone, the times when you can’ t
reach her … As long as you are looking with doubt in your
eyes, everything around you will appear to be evidence that
she is cheating on you. Even if she is not.
YOUTH:  Hmm.
PHILOSOPHER:  Right now , you are only concerned about the
times you were taken advantage of, and nothing else. Y ou
focus only on the pain from the wounds you sustained on such
occasions. But if you are afraid to have confidence in others,
in the long run, you will not be able to build deep relationships
with anyone.YOUTH:  W ell, I see what you’re getting at—the main objective,
which is to build deep relationships. But still, being taken
advantage of is scary , and that’ s the reality , isn’ t it?
PHILOSOPHER:  If it is a shallow relationship, when it falls apart
the pain will be slight. And the joy that relationship brings
each day will also be slight. It is precisely because one can
gain the courage to enter into deeper relationships by having
confidence in others that the joy of one’ s interpersonal
relations can grow , and one’ s joy in life can grow , too.
YOUTH:  No! That’ s not what I was talking about, you’re
changing the subject again. The courage to overcome the fear
of being taken advantage of—where does it come from?
PHILOSOPHER:  It comes from self-acceptance. If one can simply
accept oneself as one is, and ascertain what one can do and
what one cannot, one becomes able to understand that ‘taking
advantage’ is the other person’ s task, and getting to the core of
‘confidence in others’ becomes less dif ficult.
YOUTH:  Y ou’re saying that taking advantage of someone is the
other person’ s task, and one can’ t do anything about it? That I
should be resigned, in an af firmative way? Y our ar guments
always ignore our emotions. What does one do about all the
anger and sadness one feels when one is taken advantage of?
PHILOSOPHER:  When one is sad, one should be sad to one’ s
heart’ s content. It is precisely when one tries to escape the pain
and sadness that one gets stuck and ceases to be able to build
deep relationships with anyone. Think about it this way . W e
can believe. And we can doubt. But we are aspiring to see
others as our comrades. T o believe or to doubt—the choice
should be clear .T H E  E S S E N C E  O F  W O R K  I S  A
C O N T R I B U T I O N  T O  T H E
C O M M O N  G O O D
YOUTH:  All right. W ell, suppose I have managed to attain self-
acceptance. And that I have attained confidence in others, too.
What kind of changes would there be in me, then?
PHILOSOPHER:  First, one accepts one’ s irreplaceable ‘this me’
just as it is. That is self-acceptance. Then, one places
unconditional confidence in other people. That is confidence
in others. Y ou can accept yourself, and you can have
confidence in others. So, what are other people to you now?
YOUTH:  … My comrades?
PHILOSOPHER:  Exactly . In ef fect, placing confidence in others is
connected to seeing others as comrades. It is because they are
one’ s comrades that one can have confidence in them. If they
were not one’ s comrades, one would not be able to reach the
level of confidence. And then, having other people as one’ s
comrades connects to finding refuge in the community one
belongs to. So, one can gain the sense of belonging that ‘it’ s
okay to be here’.
YOUTH:  In other words, you’re saying that to feel ‘it’ s okay to
be here’ one has to see others as comrades. And that to see
others as comrades, one needs both self-acceptance and
confidence in others.
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right. Y ou are grasping this more quickly
now . T o take it a step farther , one may say that people who
think of others as enemies have not attained self-acceptance,
and do not have enough confidence in others.
YOUTH:  All right. It is true that people seek the sense of
belonging that ‘it’ s okay to be here’. And, to get that, they
need self-acceptance and confidence in others. I have no
objection to that. But, I don’ t know . Can one really gain a
sense of belonging just by seeing others as comrades, and
having confidence in them?PHILOSOPHER:  Of course, community feeling is not something
that is attainable with just self-acceptance and confidence in
others. It is at this point that the third key concept—
contribution to others—becomes necessary .
YOUTH:  Contribution to others?
PHILOSOPHER:  Is to act, in some way , on one’ s comrades. T o
attempt to contribute. That is ‘contribution to others’.
YOUTH:  So, when you say ‘contribute’, you mean to show a
spirit of self-sacrifice and to be of service to those around you?
PHILOSOPHER:  Contribution to others does not connote self-
sacrifice. Adler goes so far as to warn that those who sacrifice
their own lives for others are people who have conformed to
society too much. And please do not for get: we are truly aware
of our own worth only when we feel that our existence and
behaviour are beneficial to the community , that is to say , when
one feels, ‘I am of use to someone.’ Do you remember this? In
other words, contribution to others, rather than being about
getting rid of the ‘I’ and being of service to someone, is
actually something one does in order to be truly aware of the
worth of the ‘I’.
YOUTH:  Contributing to others is for oneself?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. There is no need to sacrifice the self.
YOUTH:  Uh-oh, your ar gument is starting to crumble here, isn’ t
it? Y ou’ve done a wonderful job of digging your own grave. In
order to satisfy the ‘I’, one makes oneself of service to others.
Isn’ t that the very definition of hypocrisy? I said it before:
your entire ar gument is hypocritical. It’ s a slippery ar gument.
Look, I would rather believe in the villain who is honest about
his desires, than the good guy who tells a pack of lies.
PHILOSOPHER:  Those are a lot of hasty conclusions. Y ou do not
understand community feeling yet.
YOUTH:  Then I wish you would provide concrete examples of
what you consider to be contribution to others.
PHILOSOPHER:  The most easily understood contribution to
others is probably work. T o be in society and join the
workforce. Or to do the work of taking care of one’ shousehold. Labour is not a means of earning money . It is
through labour that one makes contributions to others and
commits to one’ s community , and that one truly feels ‘I am of
use to someone’ and even comes to accept one’ s existential
worth.
YOUTH:  Y ou are saying that the essence of work is contribution
to others?
PHILOSOPHER:  Making money is a major factor too, of course. It
is something akin to that Dostoevsky quote you happened
upon —‘Money is coined freedom.’ But there are people who
have so much money that they could never use it all. And
many of these people are continually busy with their work.
Why do they work? Are they driven by boundless greed? No.
They work so they are able to contribute to others, and also to
confirm their sense of belonging, their feeling that ‘it’ s okay to
be here’. W ealthy people who, on having amassed a great
fortune, focus their ener gies on charitable activities, are doing
so in order to attain a sense of their own worth and confirm for
themselves that ‘it’ s okay to be here’.
YOUTH:  Hmm, I suppose that is one truth. But …
PHILOSOPHER:  But what?
Self-acceptance: accepting one’ s irr eplaceable ‘this me’
just as it is. Confidence in others: to place unconditional
confidence at the base of one’ s interpersonal r elations,
rather than seeding doubt. The young man found these two
concepts sufficiently convincing. Contribution to others,
however , was something he could not quite grasp. If that
contribution is supposed to be ‘for other people’, then it
would have to be one of bitter self-sacrifice. On the other
hand, if that contribution is actually ‘for oneself ’, then it’ s
the height of hypocrisy . This point has to be made utterly
clear .  In a r esolute tone of voice, the young man continued.Y O U N G  P E O P L E  W A L K  A H E A D
O F  A D U L T S
YOUTH:  I will acknowledge that work has aspects of
contribution to others. But the logic that says that of ficially
one is contributing to others, when, in actuality , one is doing it
for oneself, is nothing other than hypocrisy . How do you
explain that?
PHILOSOPHER:  Imagine the following kind of scene. It’ s after
dinner at home, and there are still dishes left on the table. The
children have gone of f to their rooms, and the husband is
sitting on the sofa watching television. It’ s been left to the wife
(me) to do the dishes and clear everything up. T o make matters
worse, the family takes that for granted, and they don’ t make
the slightest ef fort to help. In such a situation, normally one
would think, Why won’ t they give me a hand?  or Why do I
have to do all the work?  Even if I do not hear the words ‘thank
you’ from my family while I am cleaning up, I want them to
think that I am of use to the family . Instead of thinking about
what others can do for me, I want to think about, and put into
practice, what I can do for other people. Just by having that
feeling of contribution, the reality right in front of me will take
on a completely dif ferent hue. In fact, if I am grumbling to
myself as I wash the dishes, I am probably not much fun to be
around, so everyone just wants to keep their distance. On the
other hand, if I’m humming away to myself and washing the
dishes in good spirits, the children might come and give me a
hand. At the very least, I’d be creating an atmosphere in which
it is easier for them to of fer their help.
YOUTH:  W ell, that might be the case in that setting, anyway .
PHILOSOPHER:  Now , how come I have a feeling of contribution
in that setting? I have it because I am able to think of the
members of my family as comrades. If I cannot do that,
inevitably there will be thoughts running through my head
like, Why am I the only one doing this?  and Why won’ t anyone
give me a hand?  Contribution that is carried out while one is
seeing other people as enemies may indeed lead to hypocrisy .But if other people are one’ s comrades that should never
happen, regardless of the contributions one makes. Y ou have
been fixating on the word hypocrisy because you do not
understand community feeling yet.
YOUTH:  Okay …
PHILOSOPHER:  For the sake of convenience, up to this point I
have discussed self-acceptance, confidence in others and
contribution to others, in that order . However , these three are
linked as an indispensable whole, in a sort of circular
structure. It is because one accepts oneself just as one is—one
self-accepts—that one can have ‘confidence in others’ without
the fear of being taken advantage of. And it is because one can
place unconditional confidence in others, and feel that people
are one’ s comrades, that one can engage in ‘contribution to
others’. Further , it is because one contributes to others that one
can have the deep awareness that ‘I am of use to someone,’
and accept oneself just as one is. One can self-accept. The
notes you took down the other day , do you have them with
you?
YOUTH:  Oh, you mean that note on the objectives put forward
by Adlerian psychology? I’ve kept it on me ever since that
day , of course. Here it is: ‘The two objectives for behaviour: to
be self-reliant and to live in harmony with society . The two
objectives for the psychology that supports these behaviours:
the consciousness that I have the ability  and the consciousness
that people ar e my comrades .’
PHILOSOPHER:  If you overlap the content of this note with what
we have just been discussing, you should be able to gain a
deeper understanding. In other words, ‘to be self-reliant’ and
‘the consciousness that I have the ability ’ corresponds to our
discussion of self-acceptance. And then ‘to live in harmony
with society’ and ‘the consciousness that people ar e my
comrades ’ connects to confidence in others, and then to
contribution to others.
YOUTH:  I see. So, the objective of life is community feeling. I
think it will be some time before I can get this clear in my
head, though.PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, it probably will. As Adler himself said,
‘Understanding a human being is no easy matter . Of all the
forms of psychology , individual psychology is probably the
most dif ficult to learn and put into practice.’
YOUTH:  That’ s exactly right! Even if the theories are
convincing, it’ s hard to put them into practice.
PHILOSOPHER:  It is even said that to truly understand Adlerian
psychology and apply it to actually changing one’ s way of
living, one needs ‘half the number of years one has lived’. In
other words, if you were to start studying it at the age of forty ,
it would take another twenty years, until you turned sixty . If
you were to start studying at the age of twenty , it would take
ten years, until you turned thirty . Y ou are still young. Starting
at such an early stage in life means that you might be able to
change more quickly . In the sense that you can change quickly ,
you are walking ahead of the adults of the world. T o go about
changing yourself and making a new world, in a way , you are
ahead of me, too. It is okay to lose your way or lose focus. Do
not be dependent on vertical relationships or be afraid of being
disliked, and just make your way forward freely . If all the
adults could see that young people were walking ahead of
them, I am sure the world would change dramatically .
YOUTH:  I am walking ahead of you?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y ou certainly are. W e walk on the same ground,
and you are moving on ahead of me.
YOUTH:  Ha-ha. Y ou’re the first person I’ve ever met who
would say such a thing to someone young enough to be his
son.
PHILOSOPHER:  I would like more and more young people to
learn about Adler ’ s thought. And I would like more adults to
learn about it, too. Because people can change, regardless of
their ages.W O R K A H O L I S M  I S  A  L I F E - L I E
YOUTH:  All right. I readily admit that I do not have the courage
to take steps toward self-acceptance or confidence in others.
But is this really only the fault of the ‘I’? Isn’ t it also actually
a problem brought about by other people, who accuse me
unreasonably and attack me?
PHILOSOPHER:  T o be sure, not everyone in the world is a good
and virtuous person. One goes through any number of
unpleasant experiences in one’ s interpersonal relations. But
there is something one must not get wrong at this juncture: the
fact that, in every instance, it is ‘that person’ who attacks you
who has the problem, and it is certainly not the case that
everyone is bad. People with neurotic lifestyles tend to
sprinkle their speech with such words as ‘everyone’ and
‘always’ and ‘everything’. ‘Everyone hates me,’ they will say ,
or ‘It’ s always me who takes a loss,’ or ‘Everything is wrong.’
If you think you might be in the habit of using such
generalising statements, you should be careful.
YOUTH:  W ell, that does sound rather familiar .
PHILOSOPHER:  In Adlerian psychology , we think of this as a
way of living that is lacking in ‘harmony of life’. It is a way of
living in which one sees only a part of things, but judges the
whole.
YOUTH:  Harmony of life?
PHILOSOPHER:  In the teachings of Judaism, one finds the
following anecdote: ‘If there are ten people, one will be
someone who criticises you no matter what you do. This
person will come to dislike you, and you will not learn to like
him either . Then, there will be two others who accept
everything about you and whom you accept too, and you will
become close friends with them. The remaining seven people
will be neither of these types.’ Now , do you focus on the one
person who dislikes you? Do you pay more attention to the
two who love you? Or would you focus on the crowd, the
other seven? A person who is lacking in harmony of life willsee only the one person he dislikes, and will make a judgement
of the world from that.
YOUTH:  Intriguing.
PHILOSOPHER:  Some time ago, I participated in a workshop for
stammer suf ferers and their families. Do you know anyone
who has a stammer?
YOUTH:  Y es, there was a student at the school I went to who
stuttered. That must be hard to deal with, both for the person
who has it, and for his family , too.
PHILOSOPHER:  Why is stammering hard to deal with? The view
in Adlerian psychology is that people who suf fer from
stammering are concerned only about their own way of
speaking, and they have feelings of inferiority and see their
lives as unbearably hard. And they become too self-conscious
as a result, and start tripping over their words more and more.
YOUTH:  They are concerned only about their own way of
speaking?
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right. There are not many people who will
laugh at or make fun of someone when he trips over his words
now and then. T o use the example I just mentioned, it would
probably be no more than one person in ten, at most. In any
case, with the sort of foolish person who would take such an
attitude, it is best to simply sever the relationship. But if one is
lacking in harmony of life, one will focus only on that person
and end up thinking, Everyone is laughing at me.
YOUTH:  But that’ s just human nature!
PHILOSOPHER:  I have a reading group that meets on a regular
basis, and one of the participants has a stammer . It comes out
sometimes when it’ s his turn to read. But not a single person
there is the sort who would laugh at him for that. Everyone
just sits quietly , and waits in a quite natural way for the next
words to come out. I am sure this is not a phenomenon that is
isolated to my reading group. When one’ s interpersonal
relations do not go well, it cannot be blamed on a stammer or a
fear of blushing, or anything of the sort. Even though the
problem is really that one has not attained self-acceptance orconfidence in others, or contribution to others for that matter ,
one is focusing on only one tiny part of things that simply
should not matter , and from that trying to form judgements
with regard to the entire world. This is a misguided lifestyle
that is lacking in harmony of life.
YOUTH:  Did you actually convey such a harsh idea to people
who suf fer from stammering?
PHILOSOPHER:  Of course. At first, there were some adverse
reactions, but by the end of the three-day workshop, everyone
was in deep agreement with it.
YOUTH:  It certainly is a fascinating ar gument. But focusing on
people who suf fer from stammering seems like a rather special
example. Could you give me any others?
PHILOSOPHER:  W ell, another would be the workaholic. This,
too, is an example of a person who is clearly lacking in
harmony of life.
YOUTH:  A workaholic is? Why is that?
PHILOSOPHER:  People who suf fer from stammering are looking
at only a part of things, but judging the whole. W ith
workaholics, the focus is solely on one specific aspect of life.
They probably try to justify that by saying, ‘It’ s busy at work,
so I don’ t have enough time to think about my family .’ But
this is a life-lie. They are simply trying to avoid their other
responsibilities by using work as an excuse. One ought to
concern oneself with everything, from household chores and
childrearing, to one’ s friendships and hobbies and so on; Adler
does not recognise ways of living in which certain aspects are
unusually dominant.
YOUTH:  Ah … That’ s exactly the sort of person my father was.
It was just: be a workaholic, bury yourself in your work and
produce results. And then, rule over the family on the grounds
that you are the breadwinner . He was a very feudalistic person.
PHILOSOPHER:  In a sense, that is a way of living of refusing to
acknowledge one’ s life tasks. ‘W ork’ does not mean having a
job at a company . W ork in the home, childrearing, contributing
to the local society , hobbies and all manner of other things arework. Companies and such are just one small part of that. A
way of living that acknowledges only company work is one
that is lacking in harmony of life.
YOUTH:  It’ s exactly as you say! And it’ s not as if the family
he’ s supporting has any say in the matter , either . Y ou can’ t
ar gue with your father when he growls with a violent tone of
voice, ‘It’ s thanks to me that there’ s food on the table.’
PHILOSOPHER:  Such a father has probably been able to
recognise his own worth only on the level of acts. He works all
those hours, brings in enough money to support a family , and
is recognised by society—and, on that basis, he views himself
as having greater worth than the other members of his family .
For each and every one of us, however , there comes a time
when one can no longer serve as the provider . When one gets
older and reaches retirement age, for example, one may have
no choice but to live of f one’ s pension or support from one’ s
children. Even when one is young, injury or poor health can
lead to not being able work any longer . On such occasions,
those who can accept themselves only on the level of acts are
severely damaged.
YOUTH:  Y ou mean those people whose lifestyle is all about
work?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. People whose lives lack harmony .
YOUTH:  In that case, I think I’m starting to get what you mean
by the level of being, which you brought up last time. And I
certainly haven’ t given much thought to the fact that someday
I won’ t be able to work any longer , or do anything on the level
of acts.
PHILOSOPHER:  Does one accept oneself on the level of acts, or
on the level of being? This is truly a question that relates to the
courage to be happy .Y O U  C A N  B E  H A P P Y  N O W
YOUTH:  The courage to be happy . W ell, let’ s hear what kind  of
courage that should be.
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, that is an important point.
YOUTH:  Y ou say that all problems are interpersonal relationship
problems. And then you turn that around, and say that our
happiness is to be found in our interpersonal relations, too. But
I still find these aspects hard to accept. Is what human beings
call happiness merely something within our good interpersonal
relations? That is to say , do our lives exist for such minuscule
repose and joy?
PHILOSOPHER:  I have a good idea of the issues you are
grappling with. The first time I attended a lecture on Adlerian
psychology , the lecturer , Oscar Christensen, who was a
disciple of one of Adler ’ s disciples, made the following
statement: ‘Those who hear my talk today can be happy right
now , this very instant. But those who do not will never be able
to be happy .’
YOUTH:  W ow! That’ s straight from the mouth of a con man.
Y ou’re not telling me you fell for that, are you?
PHILOSOPHER:  What is happiness to human beings? This is a
subject that has been one of the consistent threads of
philosophy since ancient times. I had always regarded
psychology as nothing more than a field of philosophy , and as
such had very little interest in psychology as a whole. So, it
was as a student of philosophy that I had concerned myself, in
my own way , with the question: what is happiness?’ I would
be remiss if I did not admit to having felt some reluctance on
hearing Christensen’ s words. However , at the same time that I
experienced that reluctance, I realised something. I had given
much deep thought to the true character of happiness. I had
searched for answers. But I had not always given deep thought
to the question: how can one be happy? It occurred to me then
that even though I was a student of philosophy , maybe I wasn’ t
happy .YOUTH:  I see. So, your first encounter with Adlerian
psychology began with a feeling of incongruity?
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right.
YOUTH:  Then, please tell me: did you eventually become
happy?
PHILOSOPHER:  Of course.
YOUTH:  How can you be so sure?
PHILOSOPHER:  For a human being, the greatest unhappiness is
not being able to like oneself. Adler came up with an
extremely simple answer to address this reality . Namely , that
the feeling of ‘I am beneficial to the community’ or ‘I am of
use to someone’ is the only thing that can give one a true
awareness that one has worth.
YOUTH:  Do you mean the ‘contribution to others’ you
mentioned earlier?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. And this is an important point: when we
speak of contribution to others, it doesn’ t matter if the
contribution is not a visible one.
YOUTH:  It doesn’ t matter if the contribution is not a visible
one?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y ou are not the one who decides if your
contributions are of use. That is the task of other people, and is
not an issue in which you can intervene. In principle, there is
not even any way you can know whether you have really made
a contribution. That is to say , when we are engaging in this
contribution to others, the contribution does not have to be a
visible one—all we need is the subjective sense that ‘I am of
use to someone’, or in other words, a feeling of contribution.
YOUTH:  W ait a minute! If that’ s the case, then what you are
calling happiness is …
PHILOSOPHER:  Do you see it now? In a word, happiness is the
feeling of contribution. That is the definition of happiness.
YOUTH:  But, but that’ s …
PHILOSOPHER:  Is something wrong?YOUTH:  There’ s no way I can accept such a simplistic
definition. Look, I’m not for getting what you told me before.
Y ou said, ‘Though on the level of acts, one might not be of use
to anyone, on the level of being, every person is of use.’ But if
that’ s the case, according to your logic, all human beings
would be happy!
PHILOSOPHER:  All human beings can be happy . But it must be
understood—this does not mean all human beings ar e  happy .
Whether it is on the level of acts or on the level of being, one
needs to feel  that one is of use to someone. That is to say , one
needs a feeling of contribution.
YOUTH:  So, you are saying that the reason I am not happy is
that I don’ t have a feeling of contribution?
PHILOSOPHER:  That is correct.
YOUTH:  Then how can I get a feeling of contribution? By
working? Through volunteer activities?
PHILOSOPHER:  Earlier , we were talking about desire for
recognition. In response to my statement that one must not
seek recognition, you said that desire for recognition is a
universal desire.
YOUTH:  Y es, I did. But honestly , I’m still not entirely certain
about this point.
PHILOSOPHER:  But I am sure that the reason people seek
recognition is clear to you now . People want to like
themselves. They want to feel that they have worth. In order to
feel that, they want a feeling of contribution that tells them ‘I
am of use to someone’. And they seek recognition from others
as an easy means for gaining that feeling of contribution.
YOUTH:  Y ou are saying that desire for recognition is a means
for gaining a feeling of contribution?
PHILOSOPHER:  Isn’ t it so?
YOUTH:  No way . That contradicts everything you’ve been
saying until now . Because isn’ t receiving recognition from
others supposed to be a means for gaining a feeling of
contribution? And then you say , ‘Happiness is the feeling of
contribution.’ If it is, then fulfilling one’ s desire forrecognition is directly linked with happiness, isn’ t it? Ha-ha!
At last, you’ve acknowledged the necessity of the desire for
recognition.
PHILOSOPHER:  Y ou are for getting an important issue. If one’ s
means for gaining a feeling of contribution turns out to be
‘being recognised by others’, in the long run, one will have no
choice but to walk through life in accordance with other
people’ s wishes. There is no freedom in a feeling of
contribution that is gained through the desire for recognition.
W e are beings who choose freedom while aspiring to
happiness.
YOUTH:  So, one can have happiness only if one has freedom?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. Freedom as an institution may dif fer
depending on the country , the times or the culture. But
freedom in our interpersonal relations is universal.
YOUTH:  There’ s no way that you will acknowledge the desire
for recognition?
PHILOSOPHER:  If one really has a feeling of contribution, one
will no longer have any need for recognition from others.
Because one will already have the real awareness that ‘I am of
use to someone’, without needing to go out of one’ s way to be
acknowledged by others. In other words, a person who is
obsessed with the desire for recognition does not have any
community feeling yet, and has not managed to engage in self-
acceptance, confidence in others or contribution to others.
YOUTH:  So, if one just has community feeling, the desire for
recognition will disappear?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, it will disappear . There is no need for
recognition from others.
The philosopher ’ s points could be summed up as follows:
people can only be truly awar e of their worth when they
ar e able to feel ‘I am of use to someone’. However , it
doesn’t matter if the contribution one makes at such a time
is without any visible form. It is enough to have the
subjective sense of being of use to someone, that is to say , a
feeling of contribution. And then, the philosopher arrivesat the following conclusion: happiness is the feeling of
contribution. Ther e certainly seemed to be aspects of the
truth ther e. But is that really all that happiness is? Not if it’ s
the happiness I’m searching for!T W O  P A T H S  T R A V E L L E D  B Y
T H O S E  W A N T I N G  T O  B E
‘ S P E C I A L  B E I N G S ’
YOUTH:  Y ou still have not answered my question. Maybe I
could actually learn to like myself through contribution to
others. Maybe I could come to feel that I have worth, that I am
not a worthless being. But is that all a person needs to be
happy? Having come into this world, I think that unless I am
able to accomplish the sort of grand undertaking that future
generations will remember me for , unless I can prove myself
as ‘I, who am no one else but me,’ I will never find true
happiness. Y ou are trying to frame everything within
interpersonal relations without saying a thing about self-
realising happiness. If you ask me, that’ s nothing but evasion!
PHILOSOPHER:  I’m not really sure what you mean by ‘self-
realising happiness’. What exactly are you referring to?
YOUTH:  It’ s something that is dif ferent for each person. I
suppose there are those who want to succeed in society , and
those who have more personal objectives – a researcher
endeavouring to develop a wonder drug, for instance, or an
artist who strives to create a satisfying body of work.
PHILOSOPHER:  What is it for you?
YOUTH:  I still don’ t really know what I am looking for or what
I’ll want to do in the future. But I know that I’ve got to do
something. There’ s no way I’m going to spend the rest of my
days working in a university library . When I find a dream that
I can devote my life to, and I attain self-realisation, that’ s
when I’ll experience true happiness. My father was someone
who buried himself in his work from day to night, and I have
no idea if that was happiness to him or not. T o my eyes, at
least, he seemed forever busy and never happy . That is not the
kind of life I want to lead.
PHILOSOPHER:  All right. If you think about this point using
children who engage in problem behaviour as an example, itmight be easier to grasp.
YOUTH:  Problem behaviour?
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right. First of all, we human beings have a
universal desire that is referred to as ‘pursuit of superiority’.
Do you recall our discussion of this?
YOUTH:  Y es. Simply put, it’ s a term that indicates ‘hoping to
improve’ and ‘pursuing an ideal state’.
PHILOSOPHER:  There are many children who, in their early
stages, try to be especially good. In particular , they obey their
parents, comport themselves in a socially acceptable manner ,
and apply themselves assiduously to their studies and in
sports, and excel in extracurricular activities as well. In this
way , they try to get their parents to acknowledge them.
However , when being especially good does not work out—
their studies or sports don’ t go well, for example—they do an
about-face and try to be especially bad.
YOUTH:  Why do they do that?
PHILOSOPHER:  Whether they are trying to be especially good, or
trying to be especially bad, the goal is the same: to attract the
attention of other people, get out of the ‘normal’ condition and
become a ‘special being’. That is their only goal.
YOUTH:  Hmm. All right, please go on.
PHILOSOPHER:  In any case, whether it is one’ s studies or one’ s
participation in sports, either way one needs to make a
constant ef fort if one is to produce any kind of significant
results. But the children who try to be especially bad—that is
to say , the ones who engage in problem behaviour—are
endeavouring to attract the attention of other people even as
they continue to avoid any such healthy ef fort. In Adlerian
psychology , this is referred to as the ‘pursuit of easy
superiority’. T ake, for example, the problem child who
disrupts lessons by throwing erasers or speaking in a loud
voice. He is certain to get the attention of his friends and
teachers. Even if it is something that is limited to that place, he
will probably succeed in becoming a special being. But that is
a pursuit of easy superiority , and is an unhealthy attitude.YOUTH:  So, children who commit delinquent acts are engaging
in the pursuit of easy superiority , too?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, they are. All types of problem behaviour ,
from refusing to attend school, to wrist-cutting, to underage
drinking and smoking and so on, are forms of the pursuit of
easy superiority . And your shut-in friend, who you told me
about at the beginning, is engaging in it, too. When a child
engages in problem behaviour , his parents and other adults
rebuke him. Being rebuked, more than anything else, puts
stress on the child. But even if it is in the form of rebuke, the
child wants his parents’ attention. He wants to be a special
being, and the form that attention takes doesn’ t matter . So, in a
sense, it is only natural that he does not stop engaging in
problem behaviour , no matter how harshly he is rebuked.
YOUTH:  It’ s because of their rebuking that he doesn’ t stop the
problem behaviour?
PHILOSOPHER:  Exactly . Because the parents and other adults are
giving him attention through the act of rebuking.
YOUTH:  But previously , you spoke of the goal of problem
behaviour as being revenge on the parents, right? Does that
connect with this in some way?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. ‘Revenge’ and ‘pursuit of easy superiority’
are easily linked. One makes trouble for another person, while
trying at the same time to be ‘special’.T H E  C O U R A G E  T O  B E  N O R M A L
YOUTH:  But how … ? It would be impossible for all human
beings to be especially good, or anything like that, wouldn’ t
it? No matter what, people have their strengths and
weaknesses, and there will always be dif ferences. There’ s only
a handful of geniuses in the world, and not everyone is cut out
to be an honours student. So, for all the losers, there’ s nothing
for it besides being especially bad.
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, it’ s that Socratic paradox, that no one
desires evil. Because to children who engage in problem
behaviour , even violent acts and theft are accomplishments of
‘good’.
YOUTH:  But that’ s horrible! That’ s a line of reasoning with no
way out.
PHILOSOPHER:  What Adlerian psychology emphasises at this
juncture are the words ‘the courage to be normal’.
YOUTH:  The courage to be normal?
PHILOSOPHER:  Why is it necessary to be special? Probably
because one cannot accept one’ s normal self. And it is
precisely for this reason that when being especially good
becomes a lost cause, one makes the huge leap to being
specially bad—the opposite extreme. But is being normal,
being ordinary , really such a bad thing? Is it something
inferior? Or , in truth, isn’ t everybody normal? It is necessary
to think this through to its logical conclusion.
YOUTH:  So, are you saying that I should be normal?
PHILOSOPHER:  Self-acceptance is the vital first step. If you are
able to possess the courage to be normal, your way of looking
at the world will change dramatically .
YOUTH:  But …
PHILOSOPHER:  Y ou are probably rejecting normality because
you equate being normal with being incapable. Being normal
is not being incapable. One does not need to flaunt one’ s
superiority .YOUTH:  Fine, I acknowledge the danger of aiming to be
special. But does one really need to make the deliberate choice
to be normal? If I pass my time in this world in an utterly
humdrum way , if I lead a pointless life without leaving any
record or memory of my existence whatsoever , am I to just be
satisfied with my lot, because that’ s the sort of human being I
am? Y ou’ve got to be joking. I’d abandon such a life in a
second!
PHILOSOPHER:  Y ou want to be special, no matter what?
YOUTH:  No! Look, accepting what you call ‘normal’ would
lead to me having to af firm my idle self! It would just be
saying, ‘This is all I am capable of and that’ s fine.’ I refuse to
accept such an idle way of life. Do you think that Napoleon or
Alexander the Great, or Einstein or Martin Luther King
accepted ‘normal’? And how about Socrates and Plato? Not a
chance! More than likely , they all lived their lives while
carrying the torch of a great ideal or objective. Another
Napoleon could never emer ge with your line of reasoning. Y ou
are trying to rid the world of geniuses!
PHILOSOPHER:  So, what you are saying is that one needs lofty
goals in life.
YOUTH:  But that’ s obvious!
‘The courage to be normal’—what truly dreadful words. Are
Adler and this philosopher really telling me to choose such a
path? T o go about my life as just another soul among the
utterly ordinary , faceless masses? I’m no genius, of course.
Maybe ‘normal’ is the only choice I have. Maybe I will just
have to accept my mediocre self and surrender to leading a
mediocre, everyday existence. But I will fight it. Whatever
happens, I will oppose this man to the bitter end. W e seem to
be approaching the heart of our discussion.  The young
man’ s pulse was racing, and despite the wintry chill in the
air , his clenched fists shone with sweat.L I F E  I S  A  S E R I E S  O F  M O M E N T S
PHILOSOPHER:  All right. When you speak of lofty goals, I am
guessing that you have an image of something like a mountain
climber aiming for the top.
YOUTH:  Y es, that’ s right. People, myself included, aim for the
top of the mountain.
PHILOSOPHER:  But, if life were climbing a mountain in order to
reach the top, then the greater part of life would end up being
‘en route’. That is to say , one’ s ‘real life’ would begin with
one’ s trek on the mountainside, and the distance one has
travelled up until that point would be a ‘tentative life’ led by a
‘tentative me’.
YOUTH:  I guess that’ s one way of putting it. The way I am now ,
I am definitely an ‘en-route’ person.
PHILOSOPHER:  Now , supposing you didn’ t make it to the
mountaintop, what would that mean for your life? W ith
accidents and diseases and the like, people don’ t always make
it all the way , and mountain climbing itself is fraught with
pitfalls and often ends in failure. So, one’ s life would be
interrupted ‘en route’, with just this ‘tentative me’ leading a
‘tentative life’. What kind of life would that be?
YOUTH:  That’ s … W ell, that’d be a case of getting one’ s just
desserts. So, I didn’ t have the ability , or I didn’ t have the
physical strength to climb a mountain, or I wasn’ t lucky , or I
lacked the skill—that’ s all! Y es, that is a reality I am prepared
to accept.
PHILOSOPHER:  Adlerian psychology has a dif ferent standpoint.
People who think of life as being like climbing a mountain are
treating their own existences as lines. As if there is a line that
started the instant one came into this world, and that continues
in all manner of curves of varying sizes until it arrives at the
summit, and then at long last reaches its terminus, which is
death. This conception, which treats life as a kind of story , is
an idea that links with Freudian aetiology (the attributing ofcauses), and is a way of thinking that makes the greater part of
life into something that is ‘en route’.
YOUTH:  W ell, what is your image of life?
PHILOSOPHER:  Do not treat it as a line. Think of life as a series
of dots. If you look through a magnifying glass at a solid line
drawn with chalk, you will discover that what you thought was
a line is actually a series of small dots. Seemingly linear
existence is actually a series of dots; in other words, life is a
series of moments.
YOUTH:  A series of moments?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. It is a series of moments called ‘now’. W e
can live only in the here and now . Our lives exist only in
moments. Adults who do not know this attempt to impose
‘linear ’ lives onto young people. Their thinking is that staying
on the conventional tracks—good university , big company ,
stable household—is a happy life. But life is not made up of
lines or anything like that.
YOUTH:  So, there’ s no need for life planning or career
planning?
PHILOSOPHER:  If life were a line, then life planning would be
possible. But our lives are only a series of dots. A well-
planned life is not something to be treated as necessary or
unnecessary , as it is impossible.
YOUTH:  Oh, nonsense! What an absurd idea!L I V E  L I K E  Y O U ’ R E  D A N C I N G
PHILOSOPHER:  What is wrong with it?
YOUTH:  Y our ar gument not only denies the making of plans in
life, it goes as far as to deny even making ef forts. T ake, for
example, the life of someone who has dreamed of being a
violinist ever since childhood, and who, after years of strict
training, has at long last become an active member in a
celebrated orchestra. Or another life, one of intensive studies
that successfully leads to the passing of the bar examination
and to becoming a lawyer . Neither of these lives would be
possible without objectives and plans.
PHILOSOPHER:  So, in other words, like mountain climbers
aiming to reach the mountaintop, they have persevered on
their paths?
YOUTH:  Of course!
PHILOSOPHER:  But is that really the case? Isn’ t it that these
people have lived each and every instant of their lives here and
now? That is to say , rather than living lives that are ‘en route’,
they are always living here and now . For example, the person
who had dreams of becoming a violinist was always looking at
pieces of music, and concentrating on each piece, and on each
and every measure and note.
YOUTH:  W ould they attain their objectives that way?
PHILOSOPHER:  Think of it this way: Life is a series of moments,
which one lives as if one were dancing, right now , around and
around each passing instant. And when one happens to survey
one’ s surroundings, one realises, I guess I’ve made it this far .
Among those who have danced the dance of the violin, there
are people who stay the course and become professional
musicians. Among those who have danced the dance of the bar
examination, there are people who become lawyers. There are
people who have danced the dance of writing, and become
authors. Of course, it also happens that people end up in
entirely dif ferent places. But none of these lives came to anend ‘en route’. It is enough if one finds fulfilment in the here
and now one is dancing.
YOUTH:  It’ s enough if one can dance in the now?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. W ith dance, it is the dancing itself that is
the goal, and no one is concerned with arriving somewhere by
doing it. Naturally , it may happen that one arrives somewhere
as a result of having danced. Since one is dancing, one does
not stay in the same place. But there is no destination.
YOUTH:  A life without a destination, who ever heard of such a
thing? Who would acknowledge such an unsteady life, that
bends whichever way the wind blows?
PHILOSOPHER:  The kind of life that you speak of, which tries to
reach a destination, may be termed a ‘kinetic (dynamic) life’.
By contrast, the kind of dancing life I am talking about could
be called an ‘ener geial (actual-active-state) life’.
YOUTH:  Kinetic? Ener geial?
PHILOSOPHER:  Let’ s refer to Aristotle’ s explanation. Ordinary
motion—which is referred to as kinesis —has a starting point
and an end point. The movement from the starting point to the
end point is optimal if it is carried out as ef ficiently and as
quickly as possible. If one can take an express train, there is no
need to ride the local one that makes every stop.
YOUTH:  In other words, if one’ s destination is to become a
lawyer , it’ s best to get there as quickly and as ef ficiently as one
can.
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. And the road one takes to get to that
destination is, in the sense that one’ s goal has not yet been
reached, incomplete. This is kinetic life.
YOUTH:  Because it’ s halfway?
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right. Ener geia , on the other hand, is a
kind of movement in which what is ‘now forming’ is what
‘has been formed’.
YOUTH:  What is ‘now forming’ is what ‘has been formed’?
PHILOSOPHER:  One might also think of it as movement in which
the process itself is treated as the outcome. Dance is like that,and so is a journey .
YOUTH:  Ah, I’m getting confused … What is this about a
journey?
PHILOSOPHER:  What kind of goal is the act of going on a
journey? Suppose you are going on a journey to Egypt. W ould
you try to arrive at the Great Pyramid of Giza as ef ficiently
and quickly as possible, and then head straight back home by
the shortest route? One would not call that a ‘journey’. Y ou
should be on a journey the moment you step outside your
home, and all the moments on the way to your destination
should be a journey . Of course, there might be circumstances
that prevent you from making it to the pyramid, but that does
not mean you didn’ t go on a journey . This is ‘ener geial life’.
YOUTH:  I guess I’m just not getting this. W eren’ t you refuting
the kind of value system of aiming for the mountaintop? What
happens if you liken ener geial life to mountain climbing?
PHILOSOPHER:  If the goal of climbing a mountain were to get to
the top, that would be a kinetic act. T o take it to the extreme, it
wouldn’ t matter if you went to the mountaintop in a helicopter ,
stayed there for five minutes or so, and then headed back in
the helicopter again. Of course, if you didn’ t make it to the
mountaintop, that would mean the mountain-climbing
expedition was a failure. However , if the goal is mountain
climbing itself, and not just getting to the top, one could say it
is ener geial. In this case, in the end it doesn’ t matter whether
one makes it to the mountaintop or not.
YOUTH:  That sort of ar gument is just ridiculous! Y ou’ve fallen
into a completely self-defeating contradiction. Before you lose
face before the whole wide world, I’ll cut through your
shameless nonsense, once and for all.
PHILOSOPHER:  Oh, I’d be much obliged.S H I N E  A  L I G H T  O N  T H E  H E R E
A N D  N O W
YOUTH:  Look, in your refutation of aetiology , you rejected
focusing on the past. Y ou said that the past does not exist, and
that it has no meaning. I acknowledge those points. It is true
that one cannot change the past. If there is something that can
be changed, it is the future. But now , by advocating this
ener geia way of living, you are refuting planning; that is to
say , you are rejecting even changing one’ s future of one’ s own
volition. So, while you reject looking back, you are rejecting
looking forward, too. It’ s like you’re telling me to just walk
blindfolded along a pathless path.
PHILOSOPHER:  Y ou can see neither behind you, nor in front of
you?
YOUTH:  That’ s right, I can’ t see!
PHILOSOPHER:  Isn’ t that only natural? Where is the problem
here?
YOUTH:  What? What are you talking about?
PHILOSOPHER:  Imagine that you are standing on a theatre stage.
If the house lights are on, you’ll probably be able to see all the
way to the back of the hall. But if you’re under a bright
spotlight, you won’ t be able to make out even the front row .
That’ s exactly how it is with our lives. It’ s because we cast a
dim light on our entire lives that we are able to see the past
and the future. Or , at least we imagine we can. But if one is
shining a bright spotlight on here and now , one cannot see the
past or the future anymore.
YOUTH:  A bright spotlight?
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es. W e should live more earnestly only here
and now . The fact that you think you can see the past, or
predict the future, is proof that rather than living earnestly here
and now , you are living in a dim twilight. Life is a series of
moments, and neither the past nor the future exist. Y ou are
trying to give yourself a way out by focusing on the past andthe future. What happened in the past has nothing whatsoever
to do with your here and now , and what the future may hold is
not a matter to think about here and now . If you are living
earnestly here and now , you will not be concerned with such
things.
YOUTH:  But …
PHILOSOPHER:  When one adopts the point of view of Freudian
aetiology , one sees life as a kind of great big story based on
cause and ef fect. So, then, it’ s all about where and when I was
born, what my childhood was like, the school I attended and
the company where I got a job. And that decides who I am
now , and who I will become. T o be sure, likening one’ s life to
a story is probably an entertaining job. The problem is, one
can see the dimness that lies ahead at the end of the story .
Moreover , one will try to lead a life that is in line with that
story . And then one says, my life is such-and-such, so I have
no choice but to live this way , and it’ s not because of me—it’ s
my past, it’ s the environment, and so on. But bringing up the
past here is nothing but a way out, a life-lie. However , life is a
series of dots, a series of moments. If you can grasp that you
will not need a story any longer .
YOUTH:  If you put it that way , the lifestyle that Adler is
advocating is a kind of story , too.
PHILOSOPHER:  Lifestyle is about here and now , and is
something that one can change of one’ s own volition. The life
of the past that looks like a straight line only appears that way
to you as a result of your making ceaseless resolutions to not
change. The life that lies ahead of you is a completely blank
page, and there are no tracks that have been laid for you to
follow . There is no story there.
YOUTH:  But that’ s just living for the moment. Or worse, a
vicious hedonism!
PHILOSOPHER:  No. T o shine a spotlight on here and now is to go
about doing what one can do now , earnestly and
conscientiously .T H E  G R E A T E S T  L I F E - L I E
YOUTH:  T o live earnestly and conscientiously?
PHILOSOPHER:  For example, one wants to get into a university ,
but one makes no attempt to study . This an attitude of not
living earnestly here and now . Of course, maybe the entrance
examination is still far of f. Maybe one is not sure what needs
to be studied or how thoroughly , and one finds it troublesome.
However , it is enough to do it little by little—every day one
can work out some mathematical formulas; one can memorise
some words. In short, one can dance the dance. By doing so,
one is sure to have a sense of ‘this is what I did today’; this is
what today , this single day , was for . Clearly , today is not for an
entrance examination in the distant future. And the same thing
would hold true for your father , too—he was likely dancing
earnestly the dance of his everyday work. He lived earnestly
here and now , without having a grand objective or the need to
achieve that objective. And, if that was the case, it would seem
that your father ’ s life was a happy one.
YOUTH:  Are you telling me to af firm that way of living? That I
should accept my father ’ s constantly work-burdened existence
… ?
PHILOSOPHER:  There is no need to make yourself af firm it.
Only , instead of seeing his life as a line that he reached, start
seeing how he lived it, see the moments of his life.
YOUTH:  The moments.
PHILOSOPHER:  And the same may be said with regard to your
own life. Y ou set objectives for the distant future, and think of
now as your preparatory period. Y ou think, I r eally want to do
this, and I’ll do it when the time comes . This is a way of living
that postpones life. As long as we postpone life, we can never
go anywhere, and will only pass our days one after the next in
dull monotony , because we think of here and now as just a
preparatory period, as a time for patience. But a ‘here and
now’ in which one is studying for an entrance examination in
the distant future, for example, is the real thing.YOUTH:  Okay , I’ll accept that. I can certainly accept living
earnestly here and now , and not setting up some fabricated
line. But, I don’ t have any dreams or objectives in my life. I
don’ t know what dance to do. My here and now is nothing but
utterly useless moments.
PHILOSOPHER:  Not having objectives or the like is fine. Living
earnestly here and now is itself a dance. One must not get too
serious. Please do not confuse being earnest with being too
serious.
YOUTH:  Be earnest, but not too serious.
PHILOSOPHER:  That’ s right. Life is always simple, not
something that one needs to get too serious about. If one is
living each moment earnestly , there is no need to get too
serious.
And there is another thing I would like you to keep in mind.
When one has adopted an ener geial viewpoint, life is always
complete.
YOUTH:  It’ s complete?
PHILOSOPHER:  If your life, or mine for that matter , were to
come to an end here and now , it would not do to refer to either
of them as unhappy . The life that ends at the age of twenty and
the life that ends at ninety are both complete lives, and lives of
happiness.
YOUTH:  So, if I have lived earnestly here and now , those
moments will always be complete?
PHILOSOPHER:  Exactly . Now , I have used the word ‘life-lie’
again and again throughout our discussion. I would like to
conclude by talking about the greatest life-lie of all.
YOUTH:  Please do.
PHILOSOPHER:  The greatest life-lie of all is to not live here and
now . It is to look at the past and the future, cast a dim light on
one’ s entire life, and believe that one has been able to see
something. Until now , you have turned away from the here
and now , and only shone a light on invented pasts and futures.
Y ou have told a great lie to your life, to these irreplaceable
moments.YOUTH:  Oh, okay!
PHILOSOPHER:  So, cast away the life-lie, and fearlessly shine a
bright spotlight on here and now . That is something you can
do.
YOUTH:  That is something I can do? Do you think I have in me
the courage  to live out these moments earnestly , without
resorting to the life-lie?
PHILOSOPHER:  Since neither the past nor the future exist, let’ s
talk about now . It’ s not yesterday or tomorrow that decides it.
It’ s here and now .G I V E  M E A N I N G  T O  S E E M I N G L Y
M E A N I N G L E S S  L I F E
YOUTH:  What are you saying?
PHILOSOPHER:  I think this discussion has now reached the
water ’ s edge. Whether you drink the water or not is entirely up
to you.
YOUTH:  Ah, maybe Adlerian psychology , and your philosophy ,
are actually changing me. Maybe I am trying to let go of my
resolve not to change, and choose a new way of living, a new
lifestyle … But wait, there is one last thing I’d like to ask.
PHILOSOPHER:  And what would that be?
YOUTH:  When life is taken as a series of moments, as existing
only here and now , what meaning could it possibly have? For
what was I born, and for what am I enduring this life of
hardship until I reach my last gasp? The point of it all is
beyond me.
PHILOSOPHER:  What is the meaning of life? What are people
living for? When someone posed these questions to Adler , this
was his answer: ‘Life in general has no meaning.’
YOUTH:  Life is meaningless?
PHILOSOPHER:  The world in which we live is constantly beset
by all manner of horrendous events, and we exist with the
ravages of war and natural disasters all around us. When
confronted by the fact of children dying in the turmoil of war ,
there is no way one can go on about the meaning of life. In
other words, there is no meaning in using generalisations to
talk about life. But being confronted by such incomprehensible
tragedies without taking any action is tantamount to af firming
them. Regardless of the circumstances, we must take some
form of action. W e must stand up to Kant’ s ‘inclination’.
YOUTH:  Y es!
PHILOSOPHER:  Now , suppose one experiences a major natural
disaster , and one’ s response is to look back at the past in anaetiological manner and say , ‘What could have caused such a
thing to happen?’ How meaningful would that be? An
experience of hardship should be an opportunity to look ahead
and think, What can I do fr om now on?
YOUTH:  I agree entirely!
PHILOSOPHER:  And Adler , having stated that ‘life in general has
no meaning’, then continues, ‘Whatever meaning life has must
be assigned to it by the individual.’
YOUTH:  Assigned to it by the individual? What does that mean?
PHILOSOPHER:  During the war , my grandfather was firebombed,
and his face was severely burned. In every way , it was a
horrendous and inhumane event. It would certainly have been
within the realm of possibility for him to choose a lifestyle
with the perspective of ‘the world is a horrible place’, or
‘people are my enemies’. However , when my grandfather rode
the train on visits to the hospital, there were always other
passengers who would give up their seats for him. This is
something I heard about through my mother , so I do not know
how he actually felt. But this is what I believe: my grandfather
chose a lifestyle with the perspective of ‘people are my
comrades, and the world is a wonderful place’. That is exactly
what Adler is pointing to when he says whatever meaning life
has must be assigned to it by the individual. So, life in general
has no meaning whatsoever . But you can assign meaning to
that life. And you are the only one who can assign meaning to
your life.
YOUTH:  Then, please tell me! How can I assign proper meaning
to a meaningless life? I do not have the confidence yet!
PHILOSOPHER:  Y ou are lost in your life. Why are you lost? Y ou
are lost because you are trying to choose freedom; that is to
say , a path on which you are not afraid of being disliked by
others and you are not living others’ lives—a path that is yours
alone.
YOUTH:  That’ s right! I want to choose happiness, and choose
freedom!PHILOSOPHER:  When one attempts to choose freedom, it is only
natural that one may lose one’ s way . At this juncture, Adlerian
psychology holds up a ‘guiding star ’ as a grand compass
pointing to a life of freedom.
YOUTH:  A guiding star?
PHILOSOPHER:  Just like the traveller who relies on the North
Star , in our lives we need a guiding star . That is the Adlerian
psychology way of thinking. It is an expansive ideal that says,
as long as we do not lose sight of this compass and keep on
moving in this direction, there is happiness.
YOUTH:  Where is that star?
PHILOSOPHER:  It is contribution to others.
YOUTH:  Huh? Contribution to others!
PHILOSOPHER:  No matter what moments you are living, or if
there are people who dislike you, as long as you do not lose
sight of the guiding star of ‘I contribute to others’, you will not
lose your way , and you can do whatever you like. Whether
you’re disliked or not, you pay it no mind and live free.
YOUTH:  If I have the star of contribution to others high in the
sky above me, I will always have happiness and comrades by
my side.
PHILOSOPHER:  Then, let’ s dance in earnest the moments of the
here and now , and live in earnest. Do not look at the past, and
do not look at the future. One lives each complete moment like
a dance. There is no need to compete with anyone, and one has
no use for destinations. As long as you are dancing, you will
get somewhere.
YOUTH:  A ‘somewhere’ that no one else knows!
PHILOSOPHER:  That is the nature of ener geial life. If I look back
on my own life up to now , no matter how I try , I will never
arrive at a satisfactory explanation as to why I am here and
now . Though, at one time, the study of Greek philosophy was
my focus, before long I took up the study of Adlerian
psychology in tandem with it, and here I am today , deep in
conversation with you, my irreplaceable friend. It is the result
of having danced the moments—that is the only way toexplain it. When you have danced here and now in earnest and
to the full, that is when the meaning of your life will become
clear to you.
YOUTH:  It will? I … I believe you!
PHILOSOPHER:  Y es, please believe. Through my many years
living with Adler ’ s thought, there is something I have noticed.
YOUTH:  And that is?
PHILOSOPHER:  It is that the power of one person is great, or ,
rather , ‘my power is immeasurably great’.
YOUTH:  What do you mean?
PHILOSOPHER:  W ell, in other words, if ‘I’ change, the world will
change. This means that the world can be changed only by me
and no one else will change it for me. The world that has
appeared to me since learning of Adlerian psychology is not
the world I once knew .
YOUTH:  If I change, the world will change. No one else will
change the world for me …
PHILOSOPHER:  It is similar to the shock experienced by
someone who, after many years of being nearsighted, puts on
glasses for the first time. Previously indistinct outlines of the
world become well defined, and even the colours are more
vivid. Furthermore, it is not only a part of one’ s visual field
that becomes clear , but the entire visible world. I can only
imagine how happy you will be if you have a similar
experience.
YOUTH:  Ah, if only I’d known! I wish I had known this ten
years ago, or even just five years ago. If only I had known five
years ago, before I got a job …
PHILOSOPHER:  No, that is not the case. Y ou say you wish you
had known this ten years ago. It is because Adler ’ s thought
resonates with you now that you are thinking this. No one
knows how you would have felt about it ten years ago. This
discussion was something that you needed to hear now .
YOUTH:  Y es, I certainly did!PHILOSOPHER:  One more time, I give you the words of Adler:
‘Someone has to start. Other people might not be cooperative,
but that is not connected to you. My advice is this: Y ou should
start. W ith no regard to whether others are cooperative or not.’
YOUTH:  I cannot tell yet if it is I who have changed, or if it is
the world that I can see from that vantage point that has
changed. But there is one thing I can say with conviction: here
and now is shining brightly! Y es, it is so bright that I can see
almost nothing of tomorrow .
PHILOSOPHER:  I believe that you have drunk the water . So,
young friend who walks ahead, shall we walk together?
YOUTH:  I believe you, too. Y es, let’ s walk together . And thank
you for all your time.
PHILOSOPHER:  Thank you, too.
YOUTH:  I hope you will not mind if, at some point, I visit you
here again. Y es, as an irreplaceable friend. And I won’ t be
saying anything more about taking apart your ar guments.
PHILOSOPHER:  Ha-ha! At last, you have shown me a young
person’ s smile. W ell, it’ s quite late already . Let’ s pass our own
nights, and greet the new morning.
The young man slowly tied his shoelaces and left the
philosopher ’ s house. On opening the door , a snowy scene
spr ead out befor e him. The full moon, its floating form
obscur ed, illuminated the shimmering whiteness at his feet.
What clear air . What dazzling light. I am going to tread on
this fresh snow , and take my first step.  The young man dr ew
a deep br eath, rubbed the slight stubble on his face, and
murmur ed emphatically , ‘The world is simple, and life is
too.’A F T E R W O R D
In life, there are encounters in which a book one happens to
pick up one day ends up completely altering one’ s landscape
the following morning.
It was the winter of 1999, and I was a youth in my twenties,
when I had the great fortune of encountering such a book at a
bookshop in Ikebukuro. This was Ichiro Kishimi’ s Adorā
Shinrigaku Nyūmon  ( Intr oduction to Adlerian Psychology ).
Here was a form of thought, profound in every way , yet
conveyed in simple language, that seemed to overturn our
accepted wisdoms at their very roots. A Copernican revolution
that denied trauma and converted aetiology into teleology .
Having always felt something unconvincing in the discourses
of the Freudians and Jungians, I was af fected very deeply .
Who was this Alfred Adler? How had I never known of his
existence before? I purchased every single book by or about
Adler that I could get my hands on, and became completely
engrossed and read them over and over again.
But I was struck then by a certain fact. What I was
interested in was not solely Adlerian psychology , but rather
something that had emer ged through the filter of the
philosopher , Ichiro Kishimi: it was Kishimi–Adler studies that
I was seeking.
Grounded in the thought of Socrates and Plato and other
ancient Greek philosophers, the Adlerian psychology that
Kishimi conveys to us reveals Adler as a thinker , a
philosopher , whose work went far beyond the confines of
clinical psychology . For instance, the statement ‘It is only in
social contexts that a person becomes an individual’ is
positively Hegelian; in his laying emphasis on subjective
interpretation over objective truth, he echoes Nietzsche’ s
worldview; and ideas recalling the phenomenology of Husserl
and Heidegger are in abundance.
Adlerian psychology , which draws inspiration from these
philosophical insights to proclaim ‘all problems are
interpersonal relationship problems’, ‘people can change andbe happy from this moment onward’ and ‘the problem is not
one of ability , but of courage’ was to utterly change the
worldview of this rather confused youth.
Nevertheless, there was almost no one around me who had
heard of Adlerian psychology . Eventually , it occurred to me
that I would like to make a book some day with Kishimi that
would be a definitive edition of Adlerian psychology
(Kishimi–Adler studies), and I contacted one editor after
another and waited impatiently for the opportunity to arise.
It was in March 2010 that I was at last able to meet with
Kishimi, who lives in Kyoto. More than ten years had passed
since my first reading of Intr oduction to Adlerian Psychology .
When Kishimi said to me then, ‘Socrates’ thought was
conveyed by Plato. I would like to be a Plato for Adler ,’
without a second thought, I answered, ‘Then, I will be a Plato
for you, Mr Kishimi.’ And that is how this book was
conceived.
One aspect of Adler ’ s simple and universal ideas is that
there are times when he may seem to be stating the obvious,
while at others he is likely to be regarded as espousing utterly
unrealisable, idealistic theories.
Accordingly , in this book, in hopes of focusing on any
doubts that might be harboured by the reader , I have adopted
the format of a dialogue between a philosopher and a young
man.
As is implied in this narrative, it is not a simple thing to
make the ideas of Adler one’ s own and put them into practice.
There are points that make one want to rebel, statements that
are dif ficult to accept, and proposals that one may struggle to
grasp.
But the ideas of Adler have the power to completely change
a person’ s life, just like they did for me over a decade ago.
Then, it is only a question of having the courage to take a step
forward.
In closing, I would like to express my deep gratitude to
Ichiro Kishimi, who never treated me as a disciple, eventhough I was much younger than he, but met me forthrightly
as a friend; to the editor Y oshifumi Kakiuchi, for his steadfast
and unstinting support at every step of the way; and last but
not least, to all the readers of this book.
Thank you very much.

More than half a century has passed since the death of Adler ,
and the times still cannot catch up with the freshness of his
ideas. Though compared to Freud or Jung, the name Adler is
little known in Japan today . Adler ’ s teachings are said to be a
‘communal quarry’ that anyone can excavate something from.
And though his name often goes unmentioned, the influence of
his teachings has spread far and wide.
I had been studying philosophy ever since my late teens,
and it was around the time my child was born, when I was in
my early thirties, that I first encountered Adlerian psychology .
Eudaimonic theory , which investigates the question ‘what is
happiness?’, is one of the central themes of W estern
philosophy . I had spent many years pondering this question,
when I attended the lecture where I first learned of Adlerian
psychology . On hearing the lecturer declare from his podium,
‘Those who have listened to my talk today will be able to
change and be happy from this moment onward,’ I felt
repulsed. But at the same time, it dawned on me that I had
never thought deeply about how I myself can find happiness,
and with the notion that ‘finding happiness’ itself was perhaps
easier than I’d imagined, I took an interest in Adlerian
psychology .
In this way , I came to study Adlerian psychology side by
side with philosophy . I soon realised, however , that I could not
study them separately , as two distinct fields.
For instance, the idea of teleology , far from being something
that appeared suddenly in Adler ’ s time, is present in the
philosophy of Plato and Aristotle. It became clear to me that
Adlerian psychology was a way of thinking that lay in the
same vein as Greek philosophy . Moreover , I noticed that thedialogues that Socrates engaged in with youths, which Plato
recording in writing for posterity , could be said to correspond
very closely to the counselling practised today .
Though many people think of philosophy as something
dif ficult to understand, Plato’ s dialogues do not contain any
specialised language.
It is strange that philosophy should be something that is
discussed using words understood only by specialists. Because
in its original meaning, philosophy refers not to ‘wisdom’
itself, but to ‘love of wisdom’, and it is the very process of
learning what one does not know and arriving at wisdom that
is important.
Whether or not one attains wisdom in the end is not an
issue.
A person reading Plato’ s dialogues today may be surprised
to find that the dialogue concerning courage, for instance, ends
without arriving at any conclusion.
The youths engaged in dialogues with Socrates never agree
with what he says at the outset. They refute his statements
thoroughly . This book is continuing in the tradition of
philosophy since Socrates, and that is why it follows the
format of a dialogue between a philosopher and a youth.
Upon learning of Adlerian psychology , which is another
philosophy , I became dissatisfied with the way of living of the
researcher who only reads and interprets the writings of his
predecessors. I wanted to engage in dialogues in the way that
Socrates did, and eventually I began to practise counselling at
psychiatry clinics and other venues.
In doing so, I met many youths.
All of these youths wanted to live sincerely , but many of
them were people who had been told by worldly , jaded elders
to ‘be more realistic’, and were on the ver ge of giving up on
their dreams; people who had been through arduous
experiences of being entangled in interpersonal relationships
that were complicated precisely because they were pure.W anting to live sincerely is an important thing, but it is not
enough on its own. Adler tells us that all problems are
interpersonal relationship problems. But if one does not know
how to build good interpersonal relationships, one may end up
trying to satisfy other people’ s expectations. And, unable to
communicate out of fear of hurting other people even when
one has something to assert, one may end up abandoning what
one really wants to do.
While people may certainly be popular among those they
know , and not many people will dislike them perhaps, they
will end up being incapable of living their own lives.
T o a young person like the youth in this book, who has
many problems and has already had a harsh awakening to
reality , the views put forward by this philosopher , that this
world is a simple place and that anyone can be happy from this
day onward, may come as a surprise.
‘My psychology is for all people,’ says Adler , and
dispensing with specialised language much as Plato did, he
shows us specific steps for improving our interpersonal
relationships.
If Adler ’ s way of thinking is hard to accept, it is because it
is a compilation of antitheses to normal social thinking, and
because to understand it one must put it into practice in
everyday life. Though his words are not dif ficult, there may be
a sense of dif ficulty like that of imagining the blazing heat of
summer in the dead of winter; but I hope that the reader will
be able to grasp keys here to solving their interpersonal
relationship problems.
The day Fumitake Koga, my collaborator and writer for this
book, first visited my study , he said, ‘I will be a Plato for you,
Mr Kishimi.’
T oday the reason we can learn about the philosophy of
Socrates, who left no known writings, is that Plato took down
his dialogues in written form. But Plato did not simply record
what Socrates said. It is thanks to Plato’ s correct
understanding of his words that Socrates’ teachings are still
conveyed today .It is thanks to the exceptional powers of understanding of
Koga, who persisted in carrying out repeated dialogues with
me over a period of several years, that this book has seen the
light of day . Both Koga and I often made visits to our teachers
in our university days, and the youth in this book could be
either one of us, but more than anyone, he is you, who picked
up this book. It is my sincere hope that while your doubts may
linger , I will be able to support your resolution in all manner
of life situations through this dialogue with a philosopher .
